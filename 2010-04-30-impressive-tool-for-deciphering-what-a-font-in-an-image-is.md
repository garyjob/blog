Today I came across this very interesting problem. One of the client's image logo sent over to me was too low of resolution. The printing company I went to engage wanted to recreate create the image from scratch and thus asked me what font was being used in the image.

I was at a loss. Obviously the client was of no help, she was just an marketing executive . Doing a quick search over the internet I quickly realized I was not the first to face such a weird problem. Thankfully there is already a tool available that helps to decipher via a process of reverse engineering from a raw image file. It was truly impress. Check it out here
