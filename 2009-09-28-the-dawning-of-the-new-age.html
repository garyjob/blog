        <div class="content">
            <p>With on the onset of the latest trends happening in the internet, borders are actually being teared down. Compared to 5 years ago the type of sites I am now building for clients is a totally different breed.</p>
<p>Back then, clients were all asking for sites that look sleek,  cool and standalone. When I first built an ERP system for my second company Frontiera Group that was integrated with the EBay API, none of the other companies in Singapore were doing.</p>
<p>Nowadays instead of looking sleek and cool, clients are actually demanding for sites that are CONNECTED!</p>
<p>Yes! connectedness. This is the new buzz word with this web 2.0 trend that has dawned upon us. By connected it means the ability to populate multiple strategic places with our intended content with just the click of a button.</p>
<p>A simple illustration could be that of <a href="http://thingstodosingapore.com">ThingsToDoSingapore.com</a>, a single entry on ThingstodoSingapore.com results in a post on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Things-to-Do-Singapore/99947818586">Facebook Fan Page</a>, your own <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thingstodosingapore">facebook profile page </a> as well as a post on the <a href="http://twitter.com/ThingsToDoSg">Twitter Page</a>. Plus and update on <a href="http://ping.sg/">Ping.Sg</a></p>
<p>At the same time, it aggregates contents from YouTube.com and other blogs too.</p>
<p>Not to say the other mirror sites:</p>
<p><a href="blog.thingstodosingapore.com">blog.thingstodosingapore.com</a>
<a href="thingstodonear.info">thingstodonear.info</a>
<a href="thingsfuntodo.com">thingsfuntodo.com</a></p>
<p>Companies are starting to demand for increased ability to put contents in front the face of their target audience with less effort. That is the expectation that an IT company has to meet in the Web2.0 age.</p>
<p>Thankfully all hope is not lost, no single programmer has to spend long hours in front of the computer just to create those functions. We have the open source community to back us up. All we have to do is to just fill up the gap when we do find one. What we fill up, we give back to the open source.</p>
<p>In this web 2.0 day and age, power is no longer held in the hands of the few but divided amongst the mass.</p>
<p>Then again on the other side of things. while this utopian view is what most observe, conforming to social norms, a few tends to rise to the top. This commonly is called the black swan.</p>
<p>It is indeed worrying. Consider these black swans as the hubs and the rest of us as spooks. Suppose if someone does cripple the hub, the rest of us the spooks will definitely get affected.</p>
<p>Such a scenario was experienced on ThingsToDoSingapore.com when the Russians decided to do a denial of service attack facebook one day due to some renegade Russian expressing one radical view too much over the internet and harnessing too much support.</p>
<p>Due to the connectedness ThingsToDoSingapore has with the facebook connect API, it experienced slow loading times for the period until the facebook team fixed the Russian problem.</p>
<p>While it seems connected is a good option, it does have its pros and cons like all systems.</p>
