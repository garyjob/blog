Keep things simple. Simple should not be confused with easy.
### Business model assessment

 	- Easy to understand economics
 	- Strong defensible moat
 	- Trustworthy management who treat capital of shareholders with ownerlike care
 	- Selling at a reasonable price
 	- Able to generate high returns without excessive usage of debts

### Guiding principles

 	- Stick to companies with your circle of competence
 	- Ignore macro economics trends and analyst forecast
 	- Choosing between growth and value is a misguided one. See the business model holistically.
 	- A share in a business is basically a bond whose coupon rate you need to figure in yourself
 	- The character flaws of an individual tend to have very serious spill over effects. Always check for serious character flaws of individuals whose company you plan to invest in.

### Float

 	- Buy cash generating assets to finance purchase of more assets
 	- Insurance is a prepaid model
 	- Blue Chip is a prepaid stamp sales model

### Management of cashflow

 	- Give out dividend
 	- Share buy back
 	- Reinvest or MnA

The last option is almost always value destroying unless the management can generate ROI above it's current RoA rate. This is predicated upon a strong defensible moat.
### Leadership

 	- Confidence
 	- Perspective
 	- Ability to focus
 	- Communication
