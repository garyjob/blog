<h3>Overview</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Success depends on a large part on mindset.
- Focus the results you plan to achieve rather than the number of hours you work.
- Results are what matter most to your employers, clients and colleagues
- Personal productivity = quantity and quality of your results in achieving your own objectives
- Actively carve out time to think as opposed to constantly reacting
</code></pre>

<h3>Personal Objectives</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- How to rank Your personal Objectives

- What the world needs you for (Demand)

focus on economic fundamentals
- be open to new developments

- Time categories

- Yearly objectives (3-24 months)
- Weekly targets (1 week or less)
</code></pre>

<h3>Planning steps</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Know what you are good at and go after targets from your position of strength
- Set/write down goals and expected outcomes with explicit priorities. Be relentless about applying the 80/20 rule
- Clearly define the hypothesis behind each goal
- Tie long goals to actionable short term targets

rank your targets

rank = who requested X implied importance

- Differentiate between

- Assigned Targets: give to you
</code></pre>

<h3>Control</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Goal management

unchecked ego results in misallocation of time and resources
- catch procrastination

is it to do with your fear of failure

</code></pre>
