Backpackers tend to cover above average length distance on a daily basis to explore the places they are visiting.

Every evening, bikes are strategically placed at the entrance of each backpacker hostel in the town of Tel Aviv as well as the high potential foot print touristy junctions. 

The virality loop growth hack works in two ways. Firstly, the hostel operators  would educate guest on how to use the bikes that were left at the entrance of their guest houses. Secondly, the backpackers would ride these vehicles around town thereby increasing total number of subjects exposed to MoBike's brand.

This is how the linear acquisition loop works. Successfully onboarded guest will bring this concept to other towns. Since Mobike is able to track the whereabouts of their users, they will be able to accurately determine the next densest locale to extend their infrastructure by running a simple query of their database.

**Metric breakdown**

 	- New User - Hostel backpackers
 	- Invite - Exposure to Mobikes
 	- Branch - 1 guest or hostel operator talking about Mobike with other guests staying at backpackers
 	- Channel - word of mouth
 	- CTR - number of new users installing the App on their phone to activate MoBike
