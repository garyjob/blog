today's session was held by Rev Dr Masaki Matsubara at the San Francisco Zen Center

The most important take aways from today's session are firstly, every moment and every activity can be considered meditation. Eating, sleeping, walking, talking and looking are all considered meditation

Secondly, the most important inner activity we can do is to set the cup down. This allows the inner contents to settle so that we can see clearly what they are as well as new things which we have never before noticed
