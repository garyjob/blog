## Insights

 	- knowledge of nature gives the ability to go down the long tail for food
 	- large scale agriculture constrains us to specific food types which are easier to cultivate at scale
 	- operating at smaller scale frees us up from this constrain
 	- there are seasons in forest. Forest fire helps reset the season so that end stage vegetation does not establish permanent foothold in any territory
 	- Seeing clear distinct between function and form allows the ability to freely step off the grid
