<h2><a href="images/2017/07/IMG_7573.png"><img alt="" src="images/2017/07/IMG_7573.png" /></a> <a href="images/2017/07/IMG_7545.png"><img alt="" src="images/2017/07/IMG_7545.png" /></a>  Key Points</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- When under strong attack - lead with our strength by focusing on where we are strong at
- Types of managers

**Know-how managers**: people are who the specialist in their area of operation

The output neighboring organizations under his/her influence

- **Supervisors**: people with ownership/accountability to specific decision

The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his/her supervision or influence

- A responsive company have fewer levels of managers:

leverage on electronic communication medium
- this helps horizontally scale one of the key managerial activities - the role of information dissemination

- One on One sessions

mutual education and exchange of information
- didactic management: always ask one more question until both feel they have gotten to the bottom of the problem

- Importance of the Growth mindset

If you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage
</code></pre>

<h2>Leverage</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Creating high output depends on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage
- a team will perform well only if peak performance is elicited from the individuals in it

levers: training, motivation
- choosing language/compiler that allows engineers to solve more problems per hour of programming

- Watch out for negative leverages

Meetings are a leverage mechanism
- come prepared for meetings so as not to waste company time/resources
- Avoid micro management

activity leverage is too low
- subordinates start coming to you with every single decision that could have otherwise been made independently

- select activities of the highest leverage from other comparable ones
- Supervisory roles:

optimal 6 - 8 subordinates - half an hour dedicated to each person per week spread across multiple activities

otherwise either over-leveraged or under leveraged

- Dealing with interruptions

can be clustered and dealt with using a pre-prepared FAQ
</code></pre>

<h2>Production</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Time management

work backwards from a required deadline to know the critical milestones you must meet and when

- Production operations

Process - manufacture
- Assembly - put the manufactured parts together
- Test - make sure the entire product is acceptable

Incoming or receiving inspection - costly
- in process inspection - sampling based and not perfect

detect and fix at the lowest-value stage
- Use paired indicators - to avoid over optimizing for one and under optimizing another part of the process

- Cost

Figure out alternatives
- understand trade offs exist
- figure out the most cost effective way to deploy your resources
</code></pre>

<h2><a href="images/2017/07/IMG_7458.png"><img alt="" src="images/2017/07/IMG_7458.png" /></a></h2>
<h2>Output versus activity</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Important to differentiate between output and activities
- Focus on increasing output and not on increasing activities
- Output

number of eggs produced per hour
- increased conversion rate of new visitors to happy users for an existing product feature

- Activities

Meetings
- decision making
</code></pre>

<h2>Information gathering</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Written reports:

an archive of data
- help validate ad hoc inputs gathered during casual conversation - safety net
- forces the reporter to put his thoughts into clear coherent structure

- Conversation

high context but very sketchy
</code></pre>

<h2>Maintaining Culture</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- How you handle your own time is the single most important aspect of being a role model and leader

When you are walking around day to day to are a role model for people in the organization
- You exhibit specific decision making behavior which should be a representation of the company culture
- Our own time is the one finite resource
- Apply your time on task that gives you the most leverage

- Promotion from within

candidate has high amount of shared experience with other members of the organization
</code></pre>

<h2>Meetings</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Types

Mission Oriented Meetings

called in times of extraordinary events
- too frequent of these means underlying process is not healthy

- Process Oriented Meetings

regular protocol

- Watch out for peer-group syndrome

make sure people with veto rights are called into the meeting
</code></pre>

<h2>Planning</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Plan as far out as 5 units of time
- But act on plans for the next 1 unit of time and then regroup at end of unit
</code></pre>

<h2>Hybrid organizations</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Functional supervisor
- Mission supervisor
</code></pre>

<h2>Control</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Important to choose method of control
- Factors

Complexity
- Uncertainty
- Ambiguity

- Modes - available

Supervise - tell them what to do
- Communicate - provide them with information so that they know what they need to do
- Monitor - watch what they are doing to check for deviation
</code></pre>
