 	- Behavioral economics: Our actions in the NOW are mainly driven by what is currently in our environment
 	- Increasing knowledge does not lead to more action
 	- actual barriers

 	barrier #1 - friction: ego depletion

 	go into a restaurant and see 1000 items on the menu versus seeing 1  default menu item and 2 other menu options that you choose if you don't like the main one.

 	- barrier #2 - far off goals is less enticing than the pleasure of short term goals

 	healthier living versus that cookie

 	- barrier #3 - compounding effect of current day small actions is not intuitively obvious
 	- barrier #4 - merits are not agreed

 	- Approach

 	Think about the WHO (person) before thinking about the WHAT (behavior)
 	- Focus on the behavior instead of the outcome - send out a quiz today versus driving greater retention
 	- Focus on smaller concrete details instead of big pictures - buy vegetables instead of get people to eat better

 	- Utilizing ego depletion

 	If there are certain options you want users to choose, you place them towards the end of your customization as the default.
 	- get rid of as much choice as possible
 	- use terms that users will understand

 	- Utilizing Emotions

 	states

 	YEs! Keep doing what is pleasurable
 	- NO! Stop doing what is painful
 	- Neutral - rational state

 	- Hedonic adaptation
 	- genuine praises causes release of dopamine
 	- to drive action catch them when their emotion they are feeling is at the most appropriate for the action

 	suggesting them to go to a restaurant when they feel hungry

 	- Utilizing more specific Social Proofing messages

 	Most effective: join teachers in your school in saving paper
 	- less effective: join teachers in saving paper
 	- least effective: save paper
 	- Watch out for negative social proof
 	- Helps deal with uncertainty
 	- Hijack Authority or Expert biases

 	- Utilizing concrete Action Language

 	Concrete: Request a price
 	- Abstract: Request a quota
