A parent raising a child to become a likable adult will groom very different qualities from raising one to become a respectable adult.

The emphasis too will be different from one that seeks to raise a child to become a self-respecting adult.

It is important to raise a child to become an adult that does not rely on any form of external stimulus for his/her dopamine. Such would inevitablely result in character flaws reliant on excesses of one form or another.

On a daily basis reflect and meditate upon an observed character flaw.
