lately through practice of meditation and active listening, conversations have became less effortful and more conducive.

I realize the lack of need to strive, the absence of strain and tension during collaborations.

It becomes easier to find opportunities to show appreciation for people you work with. It becomes easier to allow others the opportunity to contribute their efforts towards endeavors you find important.
