After multiple failed iterations attempting to visit Temple Mount, on my final morning in the holy city of Jerusalem, I managed to get into the venue.

I sat myself down and focused my full attention on my five senses to find out for myself if this space would be any different from other spaces I visited in the city.

20 minutes into my undivided attention, I was approached. He proceeded to explain his purpose for seeking my attention.

The purpose was to convey a very simple message. There is only one reality/collective consciousness and there have been many people/messengers sent on different occasions to remind us of this.

It made obvious sense. He seemed really happy when I agreed there were no contradictions in the statement he just made. He then proceeded to make a video of us voicing that statement in his language. Which I happily complied. He left me a card before his happy departure.

Once again mustered my full attention on my 5 senses. It was no long before I was once again approached. This time by a dude wearing shades.

”What are you doing here?” He asked in a not so happy manner. “I am sitting” I replied. “Go” he motioned, which I did. Thus my attempt to sense if anything out of the ordinary at this venue was brought to and end.
