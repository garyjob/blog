While doing self study today for my bareboat cursing certification, I was writing with a pen on a piece of paper today.

It was an opportunity when I got to my observe the correlation between my level of impatience and the subsequent handwritten words.

The mind was already jumping way ahead with its thoughts while the hand was busy struggling to keep. The resultant handwriting was a scribble that leaned heavily to the right with sections barely legible.

it was then I recalled the admonishment of my dad when I was a kid to write clearly and legibly.

The Mindfulness practice I have been undertaking gave me a fresh perspective into the activity of handwriting.

Applying Mindfulness to this activity, the following thought occurred to me. When engaged in the activity of writing, the mind should stay in the present and give full attention to the stroke that is currently being created.

Applying this thoughtvyo practice the resultant handwriting looked straight, full and clearly legible.

handwriting is a representation of the writer's state of mind.
