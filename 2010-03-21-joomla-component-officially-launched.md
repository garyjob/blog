It was Sunday after two weeks of wait I discovered this email from some unknown addresses in my account. Curious, I took a look. It was from the Joomla team. The reviewers were finally taking a look at my submitted [Joomla 1.5 component](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/photos-a-images/photo-gallery/11803).

After some slight modifications here and there I finally had my component approved. what a great day indeed. Now I am looking into this new CMS called Ektron which we will be proposing to another one of our clients next week.
