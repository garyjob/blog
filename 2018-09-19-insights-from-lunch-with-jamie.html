            <h3>On Apple</h3>
<p>Steve Jobs was working at an apple orchard for a period of time and her resolved to just eating apples for two whole weeks</p>
<p>At the end of the two weeks, as a by product of his diet he was able to achieve an extremely heightened level of awareness. He had been pursuing the altering of his biology through food intake ever since,</p>
<p>He would conduct food experiments on himself as well as his staff at Apple by ordering only specific items to be made available in the Apple canteen. Once he ordered only vegetarian food to be made available. There were huge protest and he thus back down by allowing grass fed beef.</p>
<p>His cancer was initially curable but delay through experiments with attempting cure via various diets led him to the eventual terminal stage of cancer before he finally seemed actual treatment.</p>
<h3>On being a teacher</h3>
<p>Being part of the journey towards a learner’s moment of epiphany bring a tremendous amount of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Unlike US, teachers in Korea is revered</p>
<h3>On being of mixed descent in an American society</h3>
<p>Struggles with resolving cognitive dissonance associated with identity has consumed the major bulk of attention and energy.</p>
<p>Koreans back in Korea does not consider her one of theirs. White amongsts Americans considered her an outsider. A second class citizen in your own country.</p>
<p>Realized the importance of not having to accept what does not need to be accepted. Instead of accepting what society prescibes, define your own identity based on your own core values.</p>
<p>In times of hardship Mexican and Asian families come together and are able to pull through tough times. This is not the case with African blacks. Generations of slavery has served to dilute family ties amongst this racial group.</p>
