Recently I managed to find time and hence decided once again to start work on my [Things to Do Singapore!](http://thingstodosingapore.com)

One of the new features I had in mind of implementing was this auto updating of new sites to the[ Things to Do Singapore facebook fan page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Things-to-Do-Singapore/99947818586).  The other thing I had in mind to do was to decrease the loading time experience for the site. The third thing I attempted to do was to improve the usability of the site. The second and third issue I believe is a constant task to work upon.

So back to the first feature. I researched for a long time on the facebook api site on how to update the facebook fan page automatically. Apparently apart from using the Open Streams API there was no other way around it. I further read that this was a tedious and complicated process. Hence I thought rather than have waste too much effort in the process of recreating the wheel, I researched for readily available solution.

This was when i chanced upon this page that talks in details on [how to do auto import entries from a blog to a facebook fan page.](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2885/facebook_import_blogs_rss_feeds_without_third_party_applications/) Thus I did. I am glad he wrote what he wrote. There are so many features on facebook that sometimes i don't even know if one exist when it actually does.
