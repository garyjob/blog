**Key points**

 	- Polanyi's Paradox: We know more than we can tell - Michael Polanyi
 	- GO as the main benchmark for intelligence
 	- mastering Go with deep neural networks
 	- utilizing the crowd

**Trends**

 	- Machine: getting to human level intelligence

 	versus human mind

 	- Platform: Facebook and AirBnb dominating their verticals with none of the traditional assets

 	versus products

 	- Crowd: crowd sourcing of ideas and value

 	versus core - knowledges, processes, expertise, and capabilities companies have built over their supply chain

**Machine Age phases
**

 	- Phase 1: take over large amounts of routine work. mid-1990s
 	- Phase 2: stuff of science fiction, performing non-routine work like self-driving. now

**Machine versus human**

 	- Psychology - Daniel Kahneman

 	Fast thinking (intuition)

 	used as data point
 	- show it lots of examples and give it frequent and rapid feedback about accuracy

 	- Slow thinking (deliberate)

 	come to conclusion with it but taking data point from intuition

 	- Proposed reversal:

 	machine take human judgement as input
 	- instead of machine presenting data to human for judgement

 	- Kids learn with no priorly defined rules
 	- entrepreneurship very rewarding to individuals and societies

 	Machines not very good at large scale creativity and planning
 	- humans are really good at it

**Platform**

 	- Unbundling of offerings
 	- Curation counters the corruptors

 	reputation system
 	- keep out bad and encourage good

 	- High reputation beats high similarity - stranger-danger biases
 	- Information asymmetry leads to market breakdown

**Crowd versus Core**

 	- new knowledge is constantly created
 	- new knowledge slow to enter into core
 	- Need core principals for crowd to come together to build things of great value

 	openness
 	- noncredentialism

 	- core is often mismatched for the problems its most interested in

 	knowledge comes from domain far away from problem itself

 	- unbundling of the firm
 	- managers fall back on process of iteration and experimentation

 	avoid biases and judgments

 	- how technology is used is more important than how easy it is to access it
