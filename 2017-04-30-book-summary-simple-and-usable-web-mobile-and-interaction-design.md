### Key Points

 	- More features equals more complexity

 	the more features you add, the less chance you have of coming across a new feature that is of real value to someone. Features will fall flat
 	- building massive legacy of code that needs maintenance thereby increasing maintenance cost and slows down reaction to the market
 	- users can't easily find the features that are important to them. They also start resenting to pay for features they don't use.

 	- Three perspectives when designing any piece of technology

 	The manager's
 	- The engineer's
 	- The user's

 	- Simplicity

 	To feel in control
 	- what feels simple to someone in one situation may not be true for everyone in every situation
 	- Technology becomes interesting when it is catered for a wider audience than the experts
 	- Prioritize features that satisfy mainstream user's needs with minimal effort
 	- People recognize and place value on the small differences
 	- It does not mean want or poverty. It means anything foreign to it should be taken away
 	- Watch out for fake simplicity -

 	a.k.a. I tried my best to explain it to you. If you don't get it, its your own fault!
 	- shifting responsibility for failure onto the user
 	- most people don't bother reading instructions, they prefer to get on with doing

 	- when user needs to correct an error, it breaks his concentration and makes the experience feel complex
 	- High Data Ink Ratio: don't waste inks on anything that isn't content or in repeating content
 	- Simplify sentences

 	- Managing change within organization

 	Connecting change to the benefits

 	companies tend to measure success by making money and growing
 	- need to understand how this piece works before attempting to simplify user experience
 	- Simpler design = sell more cars or sell at higher price?

 	- Prioritizing changes

 	 divide up a fixed number of points across all desired features

 	- Benchmarking the design

 	Write down a one-line description in the simple terms
 	- Write down any guidelines I want to stick to
 	- Watching people in the real world

 	- Audiences

 	 Types

 	Experts

 	make a lot of noise
 	- wants a complex product, a.k.a. a rocket ship
 	- might be best to ignore them
 	- interested in customizing their settings
 	- value precision of control
 	- want perfect results
 	- wants to take things apart to see how they work
 	- wants an exact match
 	- wants principals

 	- Willing adopters

 	ok using fancy new features as long as we make them just a bit easier
 	- will put up with a problem because they have learned to tolerate them

 	- Mainstreamers

 	They use technology to get a job done **now**
 	- value ease of control
 	- want reliable results
 	- afraid to break something
 	- Vast majority of people are mainstreamers
 	- wants a good match
 	- wants examples and stories
 	- only really care about a bicycle will get confused by complex products
 	- Best to watch how they would use the product
 	- If you want simplicity, and to be seen as innovative, you should aim to please this group
 	- tend to forget what they learned when under pressure

 	- Key insight

 	If you want to make something simple, design what mainstream audience wants and can do when under pressure
 	- people don't graduate from one group to another even after years of using a product they tend to stay in the same group
 	- It has more to do with their underlying attitude towards technology than the amount of time spent using it

 	- Mainstreamer's Emotional needs

 	achieve a lot
 	- still feel in control  of the outcomes
 	- don't want to worry about the software or technology

 	- Capturing the experience in a story

 	describe the experience using the user's language in a story
 	- avoiding describing in too much details
 	- A good user story is brief, concrete, credible and uses relevant details
 	- Components

 	World
 	- Character
 	- Plot

 	- Test your insight by spending more time watching people in the real world
 	- Make sure to capture the correct vision
 	- Understanding what's core takes time
 	- The really great person will keep on going... and come up with an elegant really beautiful solution that works

 	- The four strategies

 	remove

 	get rid of all unnecessary buttons
 	- Do a few things far better than their rivals

 	Example: BaseCamp does a fraction of what Microsoft share point does but is described as addictively easy to use

 	- Remove the clutter to focus on solving a few important problems really well
 	- users can meet goals without distraction
 	- don't remove it because it is difficult to build!
 	- watch out for sunk cost fallacy: do not avoid getting rid of them because they are already there
 	- Watch out for What ifs - find out whether users really find the feature important
 	- Identify user's goals and set them in order of priority - focus solutions that completely meet users' high priority goals before moving on to lower priority goals

 	- organize

 	arrange the buttons into groups that make more sense

 	- Hide

 	hide all but the most important buttons behind a hatch and only reveal it when absolutely necessary to do so

 	- Displace

 	create a very simple remote control with a few basic features
 	- control the rest via a menu on the TV screen
