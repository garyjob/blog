when feeling sad, feel sad. When feeling happy, feel happy. When feeling ashamed, feel ashamed. When feeling angry, feel angry. Whatever the emotion is, cherish it, feel it for it is fleeting and it too will soon pass.

when on the receiving end of disturbing news, feel disturbed.

it is not necessary to respond to an emotion, the only obligation is to feel it.

it is a mistake to stay positive when not so. It is a mistake to deny the quality of the moment. Fully accept the moment and honestly express the moment.

When on the receiving end of disturbing news, prod and question it to fully understand what the news is. Full embrace and acceptance of this piece  of knowledge is the start of effectively dealing with it and is the path towards wisdom
