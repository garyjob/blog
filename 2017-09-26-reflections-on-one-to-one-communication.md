to ensure crisp and clear communication do the following

 	- make sure each syllable is clearly articulated. Refrain from chewing your words
 	- First and foremost communicate the heart of the issue
 	- deliberately leave space in your content delivery.
 	- Observe recipient's eye movement during deliberate space as a proxy to identify mental processes that might be on going within the recipient's mind
 	- Prod recipient for any questions and doubts he might have before progressing to the next stage of the communication
 	- Pace content delivery to ensure each piece of information gets fully absorbed at each stage
