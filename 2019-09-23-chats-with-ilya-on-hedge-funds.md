- Management fees are too high to be sustainable for funds sized below 300 million
 	- Funds sized above 300 million tend to have a shelf life of 10 years
 	- staying motivated and dedicated to the business is hard when you already have a lot of cash
 	- funds that last for a long time have founders who are absolutely focused on building up an institution that will sustain beyond the founder
 	- it is much more lucrative to build and own the system than to be working in the system
 	- Sharpe ratio above 1.5 is acceptable
 	- SnP Sharpe ratio tends to be really low
 	- important to figure out how to still generate returns in a down market
 	- qualitative assessment of the business model is what drives outsized investment returns
