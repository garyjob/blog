### Reflections

Every technology that becomes widely adopted inevitably goes through a period of gestation where the village elders (government) from various communities spend time redefining existing cultural narratives, norms and values so as to assimilate it into their daily rituals.

While the invention period might sometime be long, it should not be surprising that the gestation period is often longer. On an average gestation periods takes up to ten years.

It must be noted, in rare occurrences, in certain communities, a single rare elder (sometimes referenced by the title prophet/seer/founder) might sometimes draw from the myriad signals presented by reality, through the use of critical lens, a foundational framework upon which the rest of the community base their narratives upon. This has the effect of not just setting the community in a radically different trajectory but also kicks off a new technological arch.

Technology influences community narratives. Community narratives drives the creation of new technologies. It’s a loop.
