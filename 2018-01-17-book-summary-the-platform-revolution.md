**Three key metrics an online platform operator needs to focus on**

 	- Liquidity: likelihood a user will be able to find the inventory he is looking for
 	- Trust: knowledge/signal on how well the inventory is going to do it’s job

 	maintaining quality while unlocking new areas of supply

 	- Matching Quality: ease of finding the most relevant item for the task the user wants accomplished

 	curation:

 	needed to counter negative network effects
 	- decide what not to show specific participant
 	- gather better data on their users
 	- improve their matching algorithms overtime
 	- ensure manual curation is phased out overtime

 	once critical mass happens curation is turned over to algorithm

**Network effects (two sided market place example)**

 	- Same side effects - positive / negative
 	- Cross side effects - positive / negative

**Viral effects**

 	- user getting more users to join

**Design of a platform**

 	- focus on the why - the **core interaction**
 	- components

 	the participants - producer and consumers
 	- the value unit - from producer to consumer
 	- the filter - help remove irrelevant value units

**Operating the platform**

 	- To avoid Bloatware
 	- monitor user behavior to reveal unexpected patterns - suggest new areas for value creation
 	- user commitment is more important than user acquisition: retention and engagement
 	- Standardize interface through APIs
 	- Different life cycle requires different metrics

 	Actional
 	- Accessible
 	- Auditable

**Incumbent versus new-entrant**

 	- existing value chains and complementary assets
 	- new entrant needs differentiated launch strategy versus incumbent

**Solving the chicken and egg**

 	- solve a real problem for one side first
 	- piggyback on another platform
 	- seeding with self created value units
 	- provide incentives to attract key users to platforms - hot chics/models for dating sites
 	- big bang - dump lots of money into marketing
 	- evangelism - attract producers who will then induce their customers to come to platform
 	- micro-market - focus on fully saturating one niche at a time

**Monetization**

 	- Be wary of destroying quality of value unit during monetization process
 	- ability to monetize might increase dramatically when number of users decline
 	- approaches

 	enhanced access
 	- advertising

 	- need to decide precisely where system can afford to create friction
 	- only capture value after value unit has been created and exchange with satisfaction between producer and consumers

**Platform openness**

 	- Platform sponsorship versus platform management
 	- players

 	developers
 	- users
 	- managers

 	- learned from cities - governance

 	giving partners a voice

**Market failures**

 	- information asymmetry - one side uses facts for personal advantage
 	- externalities
 	- monopoly power
 	- risk

**Platform competition**

 	- leveraging the value of data
 	- fostering innovation and then capturing value
 	- preventing multi-homing - one person many platforms
 	- redefining mergers and acquisitions

**conditions for fertile ground needed for platform to arise**

 	- information intensive industry
 	- high regulatory control
 	- high failure costs
 	- exanokes

 	education / classrooms
 	- healthcare
