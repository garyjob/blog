        <div class="content">
            <p>Today I witnessed for myself a miracle.</p>
<p>It was dinner time, I was walking along Ocean beach back towards my car when I chanced upon a Burger King. </p>
<p>"Could you spare me one dollar please?" just while I was about to step into the Bk, a black woman asked. </p>
<p>Habitually I ignored her. </p>
<p>After looking through all the items on the menu, I got myself a junior whopper meal to keep within my calorie intake. Whilst having dinner, I observed the lady at the door. Each time someone passes by she would enthusiastically say her line. After getting ignored each time, she would direct her attention towards the magazine in front of her. Intensely she devoured the words written on these pages, mouthing each word as she read along.</p>
<p>Finally, I finished my dinner. A thought struck me just while I was about to leave BK. </p>
<p>"Can I have a double whopper burger for take away?" I asked the waiter.</p>
<p>"With cheese?" </p>
<p>"Yes" I replied</p>
<p>I decided then that my blessings have been many and so why should I not share these bountiful blessings I have been bestowed with her?</p>
<p>While waiting for the double whopper to get served, she suddenly stood up and started rearranging her hair in  the mirror, as if about to go. I started feeling anxious. What if she left before the burger was ready? </p>
<p>Now that's a really strange reaction. One usually gets anxious only when about to get something and having worries the desire does not come to fruition. Getting anxious from worries that one might miss the chance to give away something. That is no much heard of. However it was precisely the feeling I had then. </p>
<p>I suddenly recalled another angry lady along El Camino Real that hurled me abuses when I smiled at her while riding my bicycle towards downtown Redwood City. Will the same situation happen too, this lady whom I am about to offer the double whopper too does look quite tall and big. What if she perceived that such a gift was an insult towards her pride? What if she decided to hurl abuses and rain punches? It was worrying having such thoughts in my mind, I grew hesitant.</p>
<p>"Your burger is ready sir."</p>
<p>"Thanks." I said, taking the burger from him.</p>
<p>"She still has her back towards me. Hurry, why not just slip away?" I thought to myself. </p>
<p>I drew in a deep breathe and prepared myself for the worst.</p>
<p>"Here take this" I said.</p>
<p>She appeared not to have heard my words the first time.</p>
<p>"Please have this burger"</p>
<p>She turned around momentarily looking puzzled. The expression was quickly replaced by one of surprise and gladness. I let out a sight of relief and felt really happy too myself. </p>
<p>"Oh, thank you very much."</p>
<p>"No problem." I replied walking away back towards my car.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the value of the double whooper was just USD6 however the joy of having seen the look of gladness on the face of this black lady was priceless. Strange, but I really feel that I should be the one thanking her for giving me such a wonderful and priceless gift in exchange for an item of value that is so meagre.</p>
<p>I guess what was written in the book Conversation with God is quite true after all. Inherent in each and everyone of us, from those of highest rank to those of the lowest position, is the unlimited potential to create infinite value. Thus it is not really a matter of ability but more a matter of choice. Choice thus should not be based on not how much can be gain or how much will be lost, but rather how much more value will be created.</p>
