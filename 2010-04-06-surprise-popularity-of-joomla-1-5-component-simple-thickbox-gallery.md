After being frustrated having spent a long time looking for a simple gallery component on the Extensions.Joomla.org site to display my portfolio, I decided that I should write my own. To do so, I simplying incorporated the jQuery library, the Thickbox library and [created a Joomla 1.5 component ](http://name1price.com/how-to-get-customers-with-singapore-web-design-basic/free-downloads/joomla-15-tools-and-plugins/90-gallery-component-for-joomla-15.html)that required almost zero configurations. 

Users simply installed the components, select the section or category they want displayed and Viola! the page was automatically created for them. 

I used it for my own [company site](http://name1price.com/singapore-web-design-portfolio.html) to display my portfolio and suddenly had an interesting thought. I might as well have it packaged nicely and submitted to the [Joomla Extensions directory](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/photos-a-images/photo-gallery/11803). 

It took me two weeks and some minor changes here and there (mostly paperwork) to finally get it approved. 

After a few days I went and had a look at my Google analytics account which I had installed for my [company site](http://name1price.com/singapore-web-design-portfolio.html) a long time ago.

I was in for a surprise. Site traffic surged from a daily volume of less than 10 visitors a few months ago to as high as 400 daily visitors these past few days. It was totally crazy. Visitors were mostly from the US and Europe. So I guess my idea of coming up with solutions to solve potentially painful situations does seem to be a very sound.

Currently I have identified a painful situation that is being experienced in SMEs. I am working on coming up with a solution for them via the use of technology. Hopefully it will help them save time, effort and lead to increased effeciency in their work process.
