[![](http://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/icons.png)](http://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/icons.png)There was a period of 30 seconds when my browser first loaded when none of the shortcuts in my menu had any icons.

Observing my mind, I realized the shortcut visualize cues my brain was so used to were missing. My brain had to go about reading each individual words to bring into memory what each link represents.

My brain stopped its activity immediately when the icons came back.

Working backwards, my brain worked with information in the following order

 	- Associate Link to the Name
 	- Associate Name to the Icon
 	- Associate Icon to the Link
 	- When looking to go to Link, find icon
 	- Doing a quick scan of the bookmark bar, my eye instinctively scans the icons instead of read the words.
 	- The brain is lazy
 	- The brain does not retain in memory all that is there in the bookmark bar after setting it up
 	- The brain relies on the visualize cues to bring back to mind what is in the bookmark bar
