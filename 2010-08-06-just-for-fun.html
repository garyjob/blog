        <div class="content">
            <p>Life has became somewhat terribly dreadful of late. When I sit down and attempt to think of interesting things in my immediate premise which I have not done before, I draw a blank. On the other hand, it seems I am constantly bogged down with things that are routine, predictable or down right uninteresting.</p>
<p>I talked to my mom about it, this serious lack of adventure in my life of late. She said well life is like that.</p>
<p>I rolled my eye balls and walked off. If the rest of my 42 years on earth is to be no different one day from the other, it is best in my opinion to end it right this instance and avoid the unnecessary waste of precious resources by my continued existance.</p>
<p>Now the one thing that I could think of that is even remotely exciting is this phsycological game that I have in mind that I will play on myself during the coming hungry ghost festival during the 7th lunar month (also known as a phsycological mind fuck to some). Come the 10th day of the 7th lunar month which happens to the a Thursday (an inauspicious day or the week according to the Malays) I will infiltrate the supposedly haunted old changi hospital.... again!</p>
<p>Rumors have it that there is this perfectly symetrical pentagram on level 3 in one of its wings. I wonder what it would feel like to sit alone in the dark right in the heart of this accursed pentagram for the entire night as recommended by the taxi driver awaiting for my bretherns from the netherworld to make contact?</p>
<p>If the devil himself exist, I believe either one of three things will happen.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- I would be a dead or missing man by the morning of the 8th day
- I would have gone mentally insane from what I would potentially see on that night of the 7th
- I would have had the thrill of a lifetime
</code></pre>

<p>Regardless of the devil's existence, one of the following might happen</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- I will once again manage to get my sorry ass thrown out of the old changi hospital by the auxiliary police
- the auxiliary police having recognized me from my previous excursion will have me handed over to the police and the latter most likely press charges
- I will have really felt sorry for myself wasting an entire night bored shitless sitting in the center of some stupid pentagram making a fool of myself and a feast for the mosquitoes.
</code></pre>

<p>Side excursion for the 7th aside, I just downloaded this open source RPG project and had it installed on my local server. It seems very interesting compared to the commercial projects I have been handling. For once, I get to create something I want to create instead of something someone else wish created. Already I have in my a few thoroughly non-sensical ideas that are politically incorrect in the absolute sense. Then again why not? The worst case scenario is that I receive a warning letter from annoyed parties and my domain gets banned. Now my friend being a public nuisance in my opinion is always whole lot of fun. Haha!</p>
