From Johnson

 	- cut losses at 30%
 	- Exit initial capital gain at 30% - 50%, leave the rest to ride out trend

From Mike Horen

 	- In times of uncertainty, enter capital in staggered manner into market
 	- if index ceiling resistance is being rejected, expect momentum to soon turn in the other direction
 	- pattern matching using Python to predict price movement
 	- look out for Value Trap - low PE ratio, high percentage of short float. Likely to bounce upwards in the event of any good news
 	- figure out how to get historical pricing data
