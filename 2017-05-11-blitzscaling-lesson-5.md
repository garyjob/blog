 	-  Hiring

 	define the north star really well

 	not about getting market share
 	- its about how to make the web a better place

 	- hire people that want to be there because of the mission
 	- set salary at below the top of the market as an acid test
 	- don't compete based on compensation
 	- hire people where you can find them. Hire them and hire their friends. Setup the office where they are in the world and how they want to live their lives

 	Berlin
 	- Tokyo
 	- New Zealand

 	- Competition

 	focus on being asymmetrical to competitors
 	- Microsoft IE did not know how to respond to Mozilla which looked like swamp of political activists
 	- A community needs to look strong enough that it matters and weak enough that people think if they need to contribute
 	- how to give assets away that competitors can't do
 	- Get community to own more and more stuff
 	- After product market fit relationships change

 	Google was originally supportive
 	- Started seeing threats

 	- Operations

 	LinkedIn - drive growth through promise of value when we achieve the vision
 	- Start showing up and focus on working on things that matter
 	- Setting goals

 	set it
 	- monitor whether we hit it or not
 	- figure out how to get better at setting goals
 	- Hitting 71% of goals - seems about right
 	- Hitting 100% of goals - not stretching enough
 	- Market share

 	a lagging indicator
 	- can keep going up even when fundamentals sucks
 	- drive growth through value - LinkedIn

 	- Team A and Team B

 	Team A is focused on building and delivering the product -

 	Engineers
 	- Product managers

 	- Team B is focused on protecting the people in Team A from distractions

 	Office managers
 	- Finance people
 	- HR
