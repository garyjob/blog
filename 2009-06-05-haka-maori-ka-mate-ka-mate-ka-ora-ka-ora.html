            <p>Seems like a tough year, this one.</p>
<p>Things were pretty messy for me this year. I don't know whether it is good or whether it is bad.</p>
<p>I managed to get myself involved in a good paying IT project at the beginning of the year for two months for a pharmaceutical firm. The pay I 've got would have been enough to get me to Europe and start the next leg of my journey downwards to Africa.</p>
<p>However, I got myself involved with a girl the second day I got back to Singapore. Ouch! I was having a lot of dilemma deciding between her and my dreams all these while. I couldn't just leave her and pursue dreams of my own, it would have been too selfish. But having her around requires that I provide a certain level of security and comfort, which she wouldn't have been able to provide herself in this city. She is from the rural areas. It was  pretty stressful financially for me. We sometimes quarrel over these things as well, when her wants are too much for me to provide.</p>
<p>So what happened next was that I got myself involved with another project which was even more lucrative but involved a certain amount of risk.</p>
<p>That one blew up in my face. My client became illiquid and I had no choice but to pay up the team of staffs I hired for the project from my own pocket which pretty much amounts to what I have earned from my previous one.</p>
<p>So basically it got me nicely back to square one all over again. Now I am half decided between looking for a full time job which would be highly torturous or hanging on with my existing group of clients. The income I get is about the same either way.</p>
<p>However considering the fact that my girlfriend would be getting back to Singapore soon and I would need to rent a house, pay for both our daily expense until she gets work(if she does), plus giving allowances to my parents, it is a lot of stress for some one who is incomes is irregular.</p>
<p>Then again if I do indeed get myself a full time job, the salary I do get would be just enough for all these expenses I I listed above, nothing more to finance my dreams. It is really like becoming a wage slave.</p>
<p>My heart is divided. I am still stuck with this question everyday. Having sleepless nights still. Constantly I pray for a possible path to open up before me or for death to come swiftly...</p>
