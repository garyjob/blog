The Van Life idea seems like an ember that will eventually grow to become like what manifested as the Hippies movement of the 60s, the Burning Man festival and before that the Scouts movement. 

One recurring theme observed between Van Life and Burning Man is the notion of "Coming Home", where man steps away from the artificial construct he spent generations building up to finally return to nature. 

Humans in the aggregate do behave somewhat like a self adjusting thermostat forever oscillating between extremes.
