            <h2>Rationale behind the purchasing decision</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Loss aversion leading to overreaction to negative news
- Diagnosis of problem

security breach leading to loss of customer data
- missing security patch of open source Apache software
- root cause of problem

failure in data management process in company

- Inputs collected on company's position in market

there are 3 competitors in this space in total
- significant barrier to entry for new entrants
- main value it provides is credit scores for consumers who need to get loans from Banks in US
- company has a suitably well entrenched position in the market

- Comparative analysis

Prior of Equifax occurred in 2013 when President Obama and wife's personal information were stolen:
- Occurrence levels of security breaches: 9 billion since 2013

- Worst case scenario analysis:

Maximum fine ever sustained by company for similar scenarios:

Company name: AT&amp;T
- Fine amount: USD32 million
- Market Cap: USD241 Billion
- Fine / Market Cap: 0.13%

- General average market statistics

5% drop in average stock price the day the breach is announced
- 7% loss of customer
- 31% consumers discontinue relationships

- Other worst case scenarios

Bank of America

Fine amount: USD17 Billion
- Current market Cap: USD271.84 Billion
- Fine / Market Cap: 6%

- Calculation for purchasing decision

Share price drop from USD146 to USD93
- Total market Cap losses: USD5Billion
- Total market Cap before drop: USD17 billion
- Drop / Market Cap = 29%
- Max Potential Fine = USD32 million
- Revenue from 2017Q4: USD832.2 million
- Market Cap versus Max Fine:

USD5 billion versus USD32 million

- Revenue versus Max Fine:

USD832.2 million versus USD32 million
