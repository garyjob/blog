after coming to the conclusion, the hair with the current state it has grew into has became unmanageable and the weight too much strain on the follicles themselves, i went ahead and had it chopped off

the person that walked into the salon and the person that walked out is fundamentally the same except maybe USD150 poorer.

The hairdresser and the staff just kept on using the term a new person instead of a modified hair style. I consciously corrected them as they made the errorneous statement
