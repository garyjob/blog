<p>company versus company</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- It is important to understand the underlying market structure to figure out if the new entrant will have significant long term impact on existing player in the market. Areas to consider for analysis (from Micheal Porter's 5 forces model)

No negative macro event
- disruption of existing distribution channels
- market segment differentiation
- customer lock in cost

- Warning don't do it if you don't understand the dynamic clearly
- Examples:

[M1 versus MyRepublic](http://garyteh.com/2018/05/m1-versus-myrepublic/)
- [Match versus Facebook](http://garyteh.com/?p=2137&amp;preview=true)
- [MongoDB versus Amazon](http://garyteh.com/2019/02/mongodb-versus-amazon/)
</code></pre>

<h3>General restrictions</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Figure out what the macro economic trend is.
- know clearly the exit prices before entering into position

don't be greedy
- helps guard inability to execute caused by [procrastination](http://garyteh.com/2018/06/book-summary-predictably-irrational/)

- Long positions: strictly trade only on [loss aversion and recovery to mean pattern](http://garyteh.com/2018/01/summary-of-learnings-into-the-subject-of-mindfulness/) in companies with strong fundamentals
- Short positions: strictly trade only on companies within industry directly impacted by political event
</code></pre>

<h3>Portfolio Allocation</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Application of [rule of 7 +/-2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)

hold no more than 9 open positions at any time

- [Micheal Porter's 5 forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_five_forces_analysis)
- [Kelly model:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) determine percentage of fund allocated to position

Equation: ( (expected win amount * probability of win ) - (probability of lose) / ( expected win amount )

- Proposed portfolio allocation levels for each large dip occurrence

5%
- 10%
- 25%
- 50% - large dip + 5 positive Micheal porter's 5 forces check offs
</code></pre>

<h3>Expected value calculation</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- A3MG = average maximum gains during entire 3 month period for all large dips
- A3MD = average maximum drawdown during entire 3 month period for all larges
- PG = probability of successful exit
- AVW = average wait time in days before successful exit
- Daily expected value of holding a position = (A3MG X PG + A3MD X (1-PG) ) / AVW
</code></pre>

<h3>Execution Time Line</h3>
<h4>Short term: loss aversion</h4>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- 1-2 weeks time horizon

[population gets fatigue of adrenaline rush triggered off by news websites](https://garyteh.com/2019/03/hypothesis-on-timing-entry-position-into-loss-aversion/)

- Magic number 5: social proofing threshold beyond which 100% conversion occurs within population

in this case, we watch for coverage of bad news by at least 5 major news network

- Capitalize misalignment of stimulus/news’s negative impact with business model fundamental

Company versus Government
- Company versus Wall Street
- Company versus Company - no longer term impact

- Be very wary not to take long positions when conflict is between

Government versus Government where tactics directly impact
- Company versus Company - with long term impact

- Don’t be too eager to jump in too early

Ok to wait till the coast is clear
- Ok to make less on the rebound

- if entry was done too early exit at 2.5% capital losses

Johnson: Much easier to buy at a cheaper price later than to ride it all the way down and then back up. Latter requires a lot of crowd confidence which is not common.

a 20% down is a 25% up

- Dan Kwon: Don't catch a falling knife
- Don't double down capital on a bad decision

lesson from bad trade with BreitBurn  in 2015

- Exit strategy

long positions: at 5% capital gain
- short positions: at 2.5% capital gain
- Reasons

save yourself from unnecessary mental anguish by running various what if scenarios for not going along with the rest of the ride
- a good gauge is when information parity has been achieved between main street and wall street
</code></pre>

<h3>Main detractors of ability to stick to strategy during execution phase</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Inability of manage symptoms of craving - greed
- Inability of manage symptoms of aversion - fear
</code></pre>

<h4>Long term: lessons from Berkshire Hathaway</h4>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Warren Buffet:

When management with good reputation meets industry with bad reputation, its the reputation of the latter that remains intact
- A rising tide raises all boats, it’s only when the tide goes down when u know who is not wearing pants
- When two companies make the same returns, the one that needs borrow less is the more capital efficient one

- Charlie Munger

Don't just do something, stand there
</code></pre>

<h2>Warren Buffet Portfolio Strategy - Kelly Model</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Expect to utilize a long time horizon when using the Kelly model
- don't use leverage as it will force u out of a position when price tanks
- don't over bet when using the Kelly Model - penalties of over betting is much worst than under betting
- holding more than 15 positions is suboptimal
- study models in multiple domains which will help triangulate probability better

Models from field of Psychology
- Models from economics
- Models from Physics

- read widely. It’s cheaper than making own mistakes
- stick to domains you are very familiar with and have a decisive advantage versus the average investors - even tech which is becoming a bigger sector over time
</code></pre>

<h2>Advice from Johnson on trading</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Remember clearly the outcome you were expecting when you enter a position
- Don’t be greedy and expect to ride all the way to the top to levels beyond your expectation. The fall usually occurs beyond that level.
- Be conservative and hop off just slightly before your expectations are met
- changing strategy (self-narrated story) in-flight makes it hard to measure the actual effectiveness of the strategy over prolonged periods of time
- Thinking that a strategy is perfect and can be repeatedly applied without micro-calibrations and occasional drastic changes assumes environment holds constant. That is wishful thinking.
</code></pre>

<h2>Advice from Jake on trading</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Entry at a 52 week low level is ideal during a scare
- Historical context based analysis is really useful.

PCG was trading at USD7 during bankruptcy proceedings back in 2001 and was trading at the same levels period prior to bankruptcy proceedings in Jan 2019
