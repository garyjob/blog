            <p>One of my cousin just came back from China, apparently before she came home the locals gave her a bag of walnuts. My cousin's family having no idea how to eat walnuts decided to give it away. So it ended up at our place.</p>
<p>There it sat on my dining table. Until of course, who else but Alena caught sight of it. Hence the walnut eating campaign started. There she sat with my mon on the dining table, the of them started cracking and munching away.</p>
<p>I got curious so I decided to join them after a while. Apparently these walnuts could be categorized into two groups. Those with smooth surfaces and those with not so smooth surfaces.</p>
<p>All the while just picking the first one off the top my fingers could get on, I picked out the smooth ones. They cracked easily.</p>
<p>It was until a few walnuts later that I chanced upon this particular walnut with very very textured surface. It looked almost like a piece of art.</p>
<p>"Yummy ", I thought to myself "I wonder how this one tastes like."</p>
<p>Hence I put it under the nut cracker. It wont bulge. Despite having applied the same pressure as I did the others. It was a tough nut to crack.</p>
<p>I guess it does require some science to crack this particular nut. Taking it out from the nut cracker, I examined the nut in closer detail. After some long and hard thinking process, I concluded it was best to crack it in the middle where the fault line was.</p>
<p>Through indeed it cracked, however that was not the end of this nut cracking campaign, the flesh was so well protected by this tough out husk that it required more subsequent cracking before one could get at the flesh.</p>
<p>Haha, funny how come a simple walnut eating experience could turn so scientific so fast.</p>
