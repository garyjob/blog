### Loop 1 - backpackers

When backpackers first arrive they are asked to stay at other hostels in the network by booking direct instead of via Booking.com

Backpackers can arrange for free boarding in exchange for volunteering to work. Working hours are typically work 7-8 hours for 5 days a week.

Backpackers get to stay for free in other hostels within the network.
### Loop 2 - hostel operators

Hostel operators exchange cheaper inventory for what would have been more expensive staff head counts when they tap into this network of highly motivated network of volunteers who by nature of their demographic empathize the needs of their guests.

They are cobranded along with other hostels within the network. They are also cross promoted by other hostels within the network.
