With age and experience comes understanding,
With understanding comes the knowledge that somethings must never be pursued,
With the knowledge that somethings are not meant to be comes deep regrets,
With deep regrets comes profound sadness,
With profound sadness comes great emotional depth,
With great emotional depth comes great inspiration,
With great inspiration comes superb motivation to acquire more understanding and experience.

These set of relationships is non-sense. I think it is time to go to asleep and stop brooding on what Ern expressed to me.

"Since the age of twenty, I have not been happy" that was what she said to me the other day. She choose to embrace this understanding in contrast to Orlando who choose to avoid it.

"I choose to surround myself with people, so that I don't have to think. Too much thoughts, I cannot stand it" Orlando's way of life.

Good night my friends.
