### Overview

 	- Good quality decisions do not always yield good outcomes
 	- All decision makings in real life are made under uncertainty. All decisions are essentially bets about the future
 	- Decisions made in Chess are not made under uncertainty because every single permutation can be pre-computed unlike Poker.
 	- Most real life decisions are not zero-sum games

### On outcomes

 	- Real life outcomes are probabilistic
 	- Outcomes are influenced primarily by the quality of our decision (skill) and luck
 	- While the outcomes might not always be positive, having a process in place to constantly improve the quality of decision making will tilt the odds in our favor

### Implications

 	- Do not change strategy drastically just because a few hands did not turn out well in the short run
 	- For each premise understand what the base rate is
 	- Learn to be at peace with not knowing
 	- Recognize the limits of our own knowledge
 	- A great decision is a result of a good process. A good process attempts to accurately represent our own state of knowledge
 	- Watching: It is free to learn from other people's experience

### Cognitive biases that impede good decision

 	- Decisions are the outcomes of our beliefs
 	- Hindsight bias impedes against quality decision making
 	- Guard against black or white decision making
 	- Availability bias means lagging any prior conflicting data, our default setting is to believe what we hear is true
 	- Selective bias and consistency bias, means we are unwilling to change our mind despite contrary signals from the environment
 	- Avoid attribution bias
