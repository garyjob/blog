<p>Character is what allows you to reach the top and stay there</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- All these people had character
- None of them thought they were special
- They worked hard
- Keep their focus under pressure
- Stretched beyond their ordinary abilities when they had to
</code></pre>

<p>Take charge of the processes that brings and maintain success</p>
<p>People who have fixed mindset count on their talent to carry through.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- they consider themselves finished products
- They feel the need to protect themselves
- and blame
- They do everything but take charge of the process to grow
- Avoid the somebody/nobody syndrome
</code></pre>

<p>Success is a team sport</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- It maybe one person's name on the record but takes an entire team that make its possible
</code></pre>

<p>Self-confidence and hubris</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- There's only a razor's edge between self confidence and hubris
- Self-confidence is the courage to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source
- Beware of success, it can knock you into a fixed mindset - the I won because I have talent attitude
- You never stay the same, you can either go one way or the other
</code></pre>

<p>CEOs and the Big Ego</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- History

Prior to Iacocca's rise to prominence

CEO is a buttoned-down organization man
- well treated
- well paid
- essentially bland
- characterless

- After his rise to prominence

Fixed-mindset executives started vying for those labels
- CEOs became super herods
- People who preen their self egos are not the same people who foster long-term corporate health

- Fixed Mindset executives

The CEO becomes the main thing people worry about rather than reality being the primary reality
- Instead of learning, growing and moving the company forward
- It starts with the boss being worried of being judged and it ends up with everyone being worrying about being judged
- It breeds group thinking

- Growth Mindset executives

Lou Gerstner CEO of IBM
- Opened up the channels of communication up and down the company
- Create ways to foster alternative views and constructive criticism
</code></pre>

<p>On Negotiations</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Mindset has an important impact on Negotiation Success
- Ability is changeable and can be developed
- Experts in the field now believe that negotiating is a dynamic skill that can be cultivated and developed over a lifetime
</code></pre>

<p>On Relationships</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- A no-effort relationship is a doomed relationship
- it takes word to communicate accurately
- it takes work to expose and resolve conflicting hopes and beliefs
- They ***worked** *happily ever after
- Choosing a partner is like choosing a set of problems
- Change from a *judge-and-be-judged* framework to a *learn-and-help-learn* framework
</code></pre>

<p>On False growth mindset</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- People take what they like about themselves and call it a &quot;growth mindset&quot;
- There is a difference between being flexible/open-minded to being dedicated to growing a talent
- Couples who shifted from fixed mindset to growth mindset during counseling when sliding back into the fixed mindset again experience fiercer than ever bickering resulting from disappointed hopes
</code></pre>

<p>New research</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- The brain is more like a muscle
- It changes and gets stronger when you use it
- Scientist have been able to show how the brain grows and gets stronger when you learn
</code></pre>

<p>Personal Insecurities</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- many People with fixed mindset understand their cloak of specialness was really a suit of armor they built to feel safe, strong and worthy
- earlier on it may have protected them
- later on it constricted their growth
- sent them into self-defeating battles
- cut them off from satisfying mutual relationships
</code></pre>

<p>On Child rearing</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Communicate that feats of intellect or physical prowess are not all you care about
- Help them love the idea that they have to work every day for some little gain in skill or knowledge
</code></pre>
