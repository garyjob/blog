- Your startup probably won’t fail because you ran out of money. It’s premature scaling that actually kills you
 	- content loops when done properly are very scalable
 	- Growing Market places

 	GrubHub: Try growing it in one city

 	create unique pages based on

 	zipcode
 	- neighborhood
 	- colleges
 	- cuisine combinations

 	- Find a replicable way to grow
 	- Try it in another city

 	- One half of SEO is about being relevant. The other half of SEO is about being an authority

 	on GrubHub

 	restaurant owners gave their menu data
 	- visitors gave their reviews

 	- Figuring out which unique content to create

 	Pintrest

 	Look for what people were searching for on Pintrest
 	- Went to Google Keywords planner to check corresponding search traffic
 	- Check how good is the content we are servicing on Pintrest
 	- This process ensures quality since users have already indicated which content was cool!
