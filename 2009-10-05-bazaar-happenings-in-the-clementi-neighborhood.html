            <p>I happened to chance across a post on <a href="http://www.sammyboyforum.com/health-centre-ktv-lounge-tangos/147489-viet-masg-hcin-clementi.html#post4158501">Sammy Boy Forum </a>last night. It was said there was actually a special massage parlour in Clementi Ave 2 area. It was just a few streets away from my place.</p>
<p>I got curious. It felt so strange that what normally happens in sleazy places like Geylang could actually happen in heartland areas like Clementi!</p>
<p>This afternoon after finishing my session at the gym, I decided to take a walk. I finally arrived at block 354, this is where commerce mainly takes place in this area.</p>
<p>I managed to locate the "Da Jie Niang Dou Fu" shop easily. The "Da Jie Niang Dou Fu" shop is a landmark which one of the members of the sammy boy forum posted.</p>
<p>I started walking down the main stretch of block 354. Upon detailed study, I realised there were actually three shops which looked quite suspicious. They were mainly located towards the end of the 5 foot way before it took a left turn. Out of the three shops two were empty while the first one was occupied by two PRC chinese looking ladies. I guess this must be the one. Having confirmed that this location that the members of the sammy boy forum posted was no bullshit but the real thing, I kept on walking down the 5 foot way and took the left turn.</p>
<p>It was not before long that i chanced upon this really eriee looking shop. I stood outstide trying to figure out what this shop was supposed to sell, when the proprietor of the shop beside that one told me to speak to the owner.</p>
<p>Apparently this shop is run by Shaiful. I wonder if he is related to the first shop keeper that talked to me.</p>
<p>This Shaiful is a pretty interesting character. His shop has been around for the past 5 months. He apparently runs tours to places around Southeast Asia to sites that a supposedly haunted.</p>
<p>Seems like his next trip is happening on the 9th this month to Vietnam. This whole thing seems pretty bazairre and interesting. If you are a really interested to find out more about his trips just head down to location stated here on <a href="http://thingstodosingapore.com/see-things/join-ghost-hunting-specialist-shaiful-ghost-hunting-trips">Things To Do Singapore</a></p>
<p>His website is still under renovation, it is www.soulhunterz.org. I wonder when he would get it up. But I am definitely looking forward to it.</p>
