### *"Panics do not destroy capital, they merely reveal the extent to which it has been previously destroyed by its betrayal into hopelessly unproductive works"*, John Stuart Mill

### Overviews on crisis

Crisis tends to only be obvious in hindsight. People tend to be biased towards optimism even in the darkest times.

Crisis are generally triggered by a momentary lack of liquidity which leads to  a whole cascade of events. This sends the entire system into a negative tail spin. A loss of trust in the system is the fundamental problem.
#### Types of crisis

 	- Banking crisis:

 	usually triggered by rapid deregulation leading to excessive levels of volatility within system
 	- A single bank or the entire banking system experiencing a shortfall of liquidity which deteriorates into a massive bank run.
 	- takes place before financial crisis
 	- reaches highest point after financial crisis

 	- Financial crisis

 	country whose currency is not a reserve currency experiencing a shortfall of liquidity triggering off rapid exit of funds trying to avoid the negative currency exchange dip

 	- Twin crisis

 	when both bank crisis and financial crisis occur together resulting in cross feeding.
 	- economic fundamentals are deteriorating in periods preceding twin crisis

### Bank failure cause by banking crisis

[gallery ids="3649,3648,3650"]

 	- Quality of management plays a very important role in averting such crisis
 	- If bank is too big to fail

 	government will attempt to step in.
 	- To restore trust
 	- Relatively rare

 	- Smaller banks

 	will get absorbed by larger banks

 	- government interventions

 	when seen as too ready to step in will encourage moral hazard
 	- results in banks taking excessive risk
 	- want the funds to restore liquidity to come as much as possible from the private

#### Indicators for banking crisis

It is generally difficult to assess banks due to information asymmetry. Banks and government will want to delay the release of bad news to prevent deterioration of an already bad condition

Spreading the financial statements across different banks will help analysis risk

 	- Leading indicator:

 	Non-performing loans/assets as a percentage to total loans/assets
 	- Non-performing loans as ratio to loan-loss reserves

 	- Lagging indicator: net interest income falls

#### Risk assessment method

 	- CAMEL model

 	Capital
 	- Asset quality
 	- Management
 	- Earnings
 	- Liquidity

#### Roles of Banks

 	- PD - probability of default
 	- EAD - exposure at default: percentage of the amount of loan that will be affected by a default event
 	- LDG - loss given default
 	- Time horizon - the longer the time horizon the more likely the default

#### Risk assessment method

 	- general - Value at Risk (VaR) model
 	- fixed income analysis - fundamental and technical analysis

### Currency risks triggered by sovereign/country risk

 	- policy lending - subsidizing industries through banking industry
