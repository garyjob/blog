- The tech industry is cyclical

 	Consumer Tech is going out of trendy and
 	- enterprise is coming into trend

 	- Look up for parallels, for example case studies for how the following company grew

 	New Relic
 	- Rubrik

 	- Co-founder discussions

 	4 year vesting, 1 year cliff
 	- Clarify edge cases like board seat, shares and voting rights in the event of death
 	- Date first before marriage

 	need to test them on smaller scope to see if they can deliver (remunerate with profit sharing)
 	- if they prove themselves overtime, start exploring larger scope where they can work together (consider with shares)

 	- Team configuration

 	product development

 	product management
 	- engineering
 	- design

 	- Enterprise sales
 	- Finance - much later when sales is happening
