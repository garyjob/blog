**Metaphysics**

 	- Chaos and order can Co-exist

 	chaos increases in the universe,
 	- evolutionary processes create increasingly intricate order patterns

 	- An organism is part of the larger environment
 	- Evolution as a process

 	written record of achievement to avoid finding solutions to already solved problems
 	- Examples

 	DNA
 	- Technology

 	- Period required for salient event decrease as order increases

 	chaos is measured as events that are relevant to the process
 	- order is information that fits a purpose

 	organism's purpose is survival

**Technology **

 	- Arthur C Clarke's three laws of technology

 	Anything a man can envision is almost always possible
 	- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,
 	- The limits of the possible is discovered when we venture beyond them

 	- Language is a technology
 	- When elements of invention as assembled in the right way, they transcend beyond their individual parts
 	- Stages of technology life cycle

 	Stage 1 - nascent stage

 	curiosity
 	- scientific skills
 	- determination
 	- showmanship

 	- Stage 2 - Development

 	Protected and supported by doting guardians

 	- Stage 3 - Pretenders

 	Threatens to eclipse older technology
 	- providing distinct benefits
 	- missing some key element of functionality or quality
 	- Fails to dislodge existing technology
 	- Finally dislodges existing technology

 	- Stage 4 - Antiquity

 	10 percent of life cycle
 	- gradual decline
 	- purpose and functionality subsumed by new competitors

 	- Improving a solution to a problem increases order

 	defining a problem is the key to finding the solution

 	- Technology is an evolutionary process

 	speeds up
 	- innovative is multiplicative not additive

**Organism versus evolution**

 	- Organism - starts out fast and then slows down

 	humans
 	- universe big bang

 	- Evolution - starts out slow and then speeds up

**Consciousness**

 	- Schools of thought

 	DJ Chalmers: The hard problem - the mystery of the experienced inner life
 	- Consciousness is just a machine reflecting itself
 	- We are too stupid

 	- Descartes:

 	mind-body problem
 	- the paradox of how mind can arise from nonmind

**Neural Networks**

 	- Can learn subject matter with unreliable teachers
 	- Trained network reduces information

 	information is destroy during training

**human versus computer brain**

 	- human brain better at pattern recognition than thinking through logical sequence
 	- human neurons very slow speed
 	- computers are really fast at performing logical sequence operations

**Quantum computing**

 	- Hard to test
 	- Answer is not there until we look at it
 	- potentially use DNA molecules
 	- Penrose: Consciousness observing quantum uncertainty causes quantum decoherence

**Next steps**

 	- Uploading of consciousness
 	- Since 1997, wealth increase is caused by knowledge content of product and services
 	- Machine dependency
 	- Technology imposed unemployment
 	- Inter-steller colonies
 	- Evolutionary algorithms
