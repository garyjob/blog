            <p>Seriously, Alena is not the most logical person on earth. Was just attempting to continue my argument with her just now. The whole thing started last week when we were at the Kota Tinggi WaterFalls Resort, which ended with my sleeping out doors for the entire night with lots of mosquitoes as my bed mates.</p>
<p>So here went the entire flow of the argument this night.</p>
<p>"Look I am the most annoying person on earth". I stated</p>
<p>"Yes you are." she affirmed what I said.</p>
<p>"Also, we only argue and fight when we are together" I continued my exposition</p>
<p>"Yes it is true too." She continued</p>
<p>"We are not happy together." I stated</p>
<p>She didn't reply to this.</p>
<p>"Since both of us are not happy together we should part. Since you do find me annoying why continue hanging around me and get annoyed. Shouldn't you be attempting to maximize your happinese? that is what the normal thing that all humans should do. Happinese maximization."</p>
<p>"Anyways, I don't like to spend time fighting and quarrelling. I seriously have better things to do with my life, like enjoying myself and relaxing by the beach. "</p>
<p>"You are so annoying. " She finally replied</p>
<p>"Yes, I am. So why are you even trying to keep me around? The natural thing to do is to leave me and get some peace for yourself elsewhere. Anyways didn't you tell me to get lost the other night? " I asked</p>
<p>"Well, I told you to get lost, but just temporarily." She declared.</p>
<p>"What crap is this? When I get lost, I will of course get lost forever. That is the most natural and consistant thing to do isn't it? "</p>
<p>"Why are you so annoying? "</p>
<p>"Look I am annoying, in fact I am the most annoying person on this entire Earth. And I don't want to annoy you any more. So why don't you just let me leave and you get someone else? if it is money you want, there are tons guys out there that are richer and even more that will be willing to treat you better than I do. So why me? Then again, you are already working you should be starting to get your pay soon too. So why even bother getting a guy? You can even buy your own cigarettes nows. " I declared.</p>
<p>"Who on earth is like you. Are you crazy?" she screams</p>
<p>"Yes, I am and I am going to retire into monkhood in Thailand next year after Chinese New Year when things gets quiet over here. If you want to you can join me but only as a nun. "</p>
<p>"You are crazy! " she said frustrated.</p>
<p>"Yes I am, and being a normal and rational person you should leave. It is only for your own good. "</p>
<p>"No I won't. " she said</p>
<p>"Are you crazy too? Don't waste your time on a crazy person like."</p>
<p>And the whole stupid argument continues. How come it is never possible to convince her that it is only for her own better good that she leaves me alone and seek out someone else.</p>
<p>Damn it. What I truly want is just some peace and quiet. Here I am instead as if stuck with a tenacious chewing gum that refuses to get off my shoes, irregardless of how hard I try to ply it off.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should attempt at another method to convince her that being annoyed, quarrelled and fought by me is not the best way to live life.</p>
