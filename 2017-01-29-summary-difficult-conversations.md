## Conversation Part 1: Focus on what happened

 	- start by talking from a keen observer's perspective and then move on to exploring each other's stories
 	- Don't assume they meant it: disentangle intent from impact
 	- Focus on how we could rectify the error

## Conversation Part 2: The feelings conversation

 	- Talk about the feelings and the actual sensation that is going on within both people
 	- Figure out how to manage each others' feelings

## Conversation Part 3: The identity conversation

 	- Keep your balance. Understand and explain that the implication of the conversation in no way detracts from your self-image.
 	- avoid having all or nothing identities, such identities are very fragile and prevents conducive acceptance of negative feedback
