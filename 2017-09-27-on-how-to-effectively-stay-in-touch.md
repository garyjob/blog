**Key insight #1: posting to your wall versus sending individually to someone**

Sending your friend or love one an article related to his personal or professional needs from time to time is a more effective means to stay in touch.

It demonstrates to your loved one, you have him or her in your thoughts  .

As opposed to posting publicly on your Facebook wall which is more about you instead of the people you are sharing content with

Past observed examples:

 	- Jerry Luk: periodically sends contents via direct Facebook Message to friends
 	- Brian Kennish: periodically sends articles to journalist in his network whom he thinks would find it useful
 	- Sonya Gorski: explained a relative occasionally send her article clippings from magazines or newspaper

**Key insight #2: priming**

when you click the photo button in you WeChat app for the first time, WeChat primes on the social utility of that feature by describing how it would serve your social needs.

Prior to that, WeChat never bothers you with what this feature is used for.

A nice coupling of curiosity and High context priming
