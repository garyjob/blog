[![](http://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/concept_to_metric.png)](http://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/concept_to_metric.png)This graph was originally referenced from [article written by Casey Winters](https://www.reforge.com/brief/how-to-move-towards-growth-team-autonomy). While his article is primarily focused on how to improve the way growth teams operate, it also documents the phases a product will necessarily need to go through.

The sections in red are traditionally handled by the following roles:

 	- Founder in a startup in pre-product market fit phase
 	- Product Manager in a mid-size startup in growth phase
 	- User Researcher or Trained Anthropologies in a relatively mature company
