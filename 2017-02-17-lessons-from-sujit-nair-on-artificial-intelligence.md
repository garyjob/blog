Areas to look at

 	- 1 hot encoding for categorical variables

 	- 
Random forest for tackling over fitting

 	- 
Scikit learn

Resources/concepts to reference

 	- 
YouTube video reference: 3blue1brown
 	- 
Study linear algebra
 	- 
L2 regularization - for Bayesian classification

 	Down sampling

 	to ensure category within dataset does not crowd out other category
 	- Example if 85% are negative examples, we need to figure out how to reduce this percentage from 85%

 	- Up sampling

 	to ensure category within dataset is not under-represented
 	- Example if only 5% are positive examples, we need to figure out how to increase the examples by coming up with more variants within this dataset so as to boost it above 5%

Recent trends

 	- Technical trend: One shot learning

 	how to determine features and corresponding coefficients from examination of limited dataset - assumption is that small data is big data in disguise
 	- 
Counter argument against this trend - humans are born with rudimentary mental model which means that they are born knowing what these features are

 	- Political and Social trend: DAT ASS - Data and Artificial Intelligence as a service

Top conferences for machine learning

 	- International conference on machine learning - ICML
 	- NIPS
