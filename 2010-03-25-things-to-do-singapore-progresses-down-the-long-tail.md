I checked the statistics of [ThingsToDoSingapore.com](http://thingstodosingapore.com) apparently traffic has been quite stable recently over the past few days with average daily volume at 150 visitors per day. 
Checking out google analytics I realised that [ThingsToDoSingapore.com](http://thingstodosingapore.com) has been indexed by Google on over 2300++ keywords. A few of these keywords experience high daily search volumes per day while others experience more occasional visits which last for longer than average visit lenght. 

It seems like [ThingsToDoSingapore.com](http://thingstodosingapore.com) with 600++ pages so far is getting a nice long tail in terms of traffic at the moment.
