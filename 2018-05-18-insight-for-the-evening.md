Framing biases: Be aware of the framing that comes accompanied with the information, especially those loaded with strong emotions.

Lack of awareness of framing could result in thinking down the wrong path leading to subsequent time waste

Most especially, be wary of the script/narrative that is playing out in your head. This pattern becomes an infinity recursive loop that consumes resources without yielding any new meaningful outcomes.

Separate the raw emotions from the underlying data and the framing. Remember John D Rockefeller. Opt to be effective over being amicable

Every resource deployment need necessarily be tied clearly to the proving or disproving of a hypothesis thus in the process eliciting an undeniable truth about our environment.
