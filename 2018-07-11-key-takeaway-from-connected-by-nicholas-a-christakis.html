<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Our ties to others affect emotions, sex, health, politics, money, evolution and technology
- Acts of aggression typical set off a cascade of killings

morality resides in groups instead of individuals
</code></pre>

<h3><a href="images/2018/07/ways_to_connect-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/2018/07/ways_to_connect-1.jpg" /></a></h3>
<h3>Insights</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- the particular pattern of ties are more important than the individuals
- different patterns facilitate the individuals in the groups
- structures are more important than shared traits of individuals
- we influence how densely connected we are
- core discussions network decreases as we age
- needs tending and should not be taken for granted
- our mirror neurons gets affected by our network
</code></pre>

<h3>Principles</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- emergent properties

inherent in the interactions and interconnection of the parts

- Rule 5 - social proofing from 5 people is as effective as any number above that
- 6 degree of connectedness
- 3 degrees of influence

network instability inhibits 4th degrees

- Situational inequality

where you are in the network matters
- affects if you are healthier or richer than others
- even if you have no control
</code></pre>

<h3>On Mating</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- your network will find a mate for you

being in a network with more men than women makes it harder to find a partner and leads to a shorter life

- Much easier to go for a guy that other women in your network are going for

assessment is already done by others

- Men bring money and resources to the table
- Women bring emotional/social support
- friendship network and mating network are very different
</code></pre>

<h3>On Friendship</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Habits / behavior spread - culture

obesity
- suicide

- can be attributed to mirror neurons
- behavior of female is more contagious than the behavior of male
- people who have five friends who know one another has a different genetic makeup than a person with five friends who do not know one another

religion is the opiate of disconnected people
</code></pre>

<h3>On Health</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Targeting folks at the central of a network to treat an epidemic is more effective than treating those at the fringes in the case of aids
</code></pre>

<h3>On Politics</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Being in a politically active network makes you more likely to vote even in they support the opposing politician
- peer pressure
- voting makes no logical sense, since your impact is statistically insignificant
</code></pre>

<h3><a href="images/2018/07/levy_flights.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/2018/07/levy_flights.jpg" /></a></h3>
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Contagion goes through a pattern called Levy Flight

imagine a seagull
- Mathematicians

Pierre Levy
- Benoit Mandelbrot

- Weighted average of the crowd is not that inaccurate
</code></pre>

<h3>Weak ties versus Strong ties</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Strong ties help dissemination within networks
- Weak ties act as bridge between different networks

useful for search large areas of networks
- people with lots of weak ties get more frequently sought out for advice and given opportunities
- they become central to the overall network
- minority power effect - a small group of influentially positioned individuals can consistently get their way

- it appears we often start our search for information two or three degrees away to make sure we learn something new
</code></pre>

<h3>On language</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- makes it easier to interact with people as types rather than as individuals
</code></pre>

<h3>Online networks</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- roles

Co-operators
- free riders
- punishers

manages public good versus private good
</code></pre>
