 	- mid term portion of portfolio which you will need to access within 3-5 years that will likely experience at least one recession should be place partially in stocks and partially in bonds
 	- long term portion of portfolio which you will need to access within 10 years that will likely experience at least a few recessions should be placed fully in stocks
