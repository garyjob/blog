In Karl Marx's Das Kapital, I see huge similarities between the society during his time of writing and our current day. Corporations well optimized for profitability while workers work long hours without making enough to sustain themselves.

Currently, blue collared workers are either unemployed or getting paid close to minimal wage. With the growing prevalence of trend 996, where overworking gets glorified, even knowledge workers are working increasingly long hours while stuck living in areas paying ever increasing rent.

The only distinct between what is observed now and then is the promise of upward mobility through hard work, some call it the "American Dream". Based on my observation even that is getting slaughtered.

Based on the current trajectory, I foresee a day majority of our population wakes up to realize the dream is in fact just a dream and a set of ideology similar to Karl Marx's gain widespread popularity amongst the masses.
