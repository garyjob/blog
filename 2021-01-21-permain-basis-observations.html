            <h3>American frontier society principles and worldview</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Trump is the best president that God has given to America
- God's deeds are done in actions not words
- If you do not appreciate what God has given, it was be taken away and replaced with something not as good
- God created put the government in place to maintain law and order
- Your purpose is to become the best possible version of yourself in service to God
- What you can do you keep. This is how you keep cash in the business
- Observe the actions not the words. When you follow your line of reasoning from actions that actually happened, the outcome of your thought process must be true
- Apply the principles of auto-suggestion. People will more readily to respond to your actions than your words. Never use it for evil. Examples:

stand by the road on the highway holding an empty tank and chances are someone would stop by and offer you a ride to get gas
- setup a table properly with all the meal and bring out a container showing empty butter and the guest will likely volunteer to go get butter
