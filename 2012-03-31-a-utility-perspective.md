From a utility perspective, the world could be viewed to consist of three group of elements - currencies/resources, catalyst and problems.

Currencies come in many forms -  money, power, prestige, fame, looks, intelligence, connections, physical strength and raw materials.

Catalysts can be defined as any function that takes in a set of currencies in a certain proportion and convert them into a resultant set of currencies in a certain proportion.

A problem can be solved through the use of a set of currencies in certain proportion.

A trivial problem is when currencies in the proportion required for a resolution is available.

A complex problem is when currencies in the proportion required for a resolution is not available at hand and the utilization of catalysts is required.
