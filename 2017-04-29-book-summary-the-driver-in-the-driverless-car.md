### Conditions the presage the leap into the future in any specific economic segment or type of service

 	- Systemic requisite:

 	Widespread dissatisfaction - latent or overt with the status quo

 	- Technology requisite:

 	Moore's Law

 	Cheap computers
 	- Cheap sensors - IOT
 	- increase in Connection speed
 	- Hand hosted AI

 	- IOT

 	software
 	- data connectivity
 	- Handheld computing

 	- Artificial Intelligence and Automation

 	Shift of discrete analog task into networked digital one

### Five paradigms of computing

 	- Electromechanical
 	- Relay
 	- Vaccuum tube
 	- Discrete transistor
 	- Integrated circuits - Moores' Law

### Current Concerns

 	- Speed of technology evolution versus  speed of regulation - codified ethics
 	- Equality, Risks and Dependency versus Autonomy

 	Does the technology have the potential to benefit everyone?
 	- What are the risk and rewards?
 	- Does the technology more strongly promote autonomy or dependence?

 	cheap software based technologies inexpensively scaled to reach millions-billions
 	- the more revenue generated the more motivated developers would want to share it broadly

### Future Concerns

 	- Biometric theft
 	- Merging of humans with computers
 	- Extent of Gene alteration that is socially acceptable - new class of humans differentiated by genetic differences

 	mitigating health risk
 	- higher intelligence
 	- better looks
 	- greater strength

 	- Privacy will be a thing of the pass
 	- Navigating technology trends as a navigator instead of a passenger
 	- Large scale drone attacks

## Artificial Intelligence

 	- Definition: a cheap reliable industrial grade digital smartness running behind everything, Kevin Kelly, Editor of WIRED magazine
 	-  Types

 	Narrow AI
 	- Strong/General AI

 	Watson

 	- Impact of existing human occupations

 	Doctors in health care
 	- Lawyers

## Education

 	- Ancient Greece:

 	Socratic process whereby teacher guided students through the learning process by asking them questions
 	- Education was privilege reserved for the elites

 	- Middle Ages/Renaissance

 	Remained a priviledge
 	- process of learning became more rote
 	- more memorization

 	- Online Education

 	Example: Khan academy
 	- Researchers found people most likely to take advantage of online courses were those who need the least help
 	- LA Unified: giving each student a tablet failed to move the needle

 	- Minimally invasive Education, Mitra, New Delhi

 	NIIT building, Kalkaji slums
 	- Key component of the learning process was the group dynamic
 	- Self taught scholars learned as quick as school-bound peers

 	- Self directed learning - flipped model of education

 	teacher no longer broadcast information, write lesson plans or stand in front of classes lecturing
 	- teachers became coaches and guides to students needing additional help
 	- students consumed recorded lectures or videos online at their own pace and in their own time
 	- Teachers focus on judgment, nuances and emotional intelligence

## Mores law and poverty

 	- Comparatively poorer parts of the world will be able to leap frog into more modern and efficient era

 	wireless mobile phones
 	- drones for deliver
 	- Solar energy power plants
 	- driver less cars

 	no need for traffic lights
 	- freeways
 	- Parking spaces

 	- USA has no monopoly on innovation

## Driver less Cars

 	- Access versus ownership
 	- Baidu, Google, Tesla
 	- China

 	Bejing, Wuhu and Anhui

 	- Singapore
 	- city layouts become more flexible
 	- commuting is less a hassle

## Current trends

 	- Plasma based water purification technology: kills 100% of bacteria and viruses
 	- Energy
