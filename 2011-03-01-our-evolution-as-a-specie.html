        <div class="content">
            <p>Today while corresponding with Embre over the email this idea occurred to me. It is an idea which I thought would be useful for myself if I put it down into writings for future references.</p>
<p>Based on my understanding, the degree to which a product or service type is unique (the proximity of it to the apex of creativity and art) determines the general price at which the product or service will be procured.</p>
<p><strong>Case One</strong></p>
<p>A simple 5 pages web design is a commodity and will hence have problem fetching a price more than 10k, whereas a mission critical system that forms the core of the a company's operations will unlikely be sold for anything less than 10K (in fact a company will start having doubts if that item is sold for less)</p>
<p><strong>Case Two</strong>
A mass produced casio watch is a commodity and hence will have problems fetching a price more than $100, whereas a new hand crafted Rolex time piece (art)  will unlikely be sold for anything less than $5000.</p>
<p><strong>Case Three</strong></p>
<p>A mass produced retail clothing item is a commodity and will hence have a problem fetching a high price, whereas a limited edition designer clothing item will likely fetch at least a 100 times the price of its commodity substitute.</p>
<p>As technology improves and more power is placed in the hands of the individual, more and more items will be commodified, however due to this newly formed based of commodities, the newly formed economic environment will make possible the support of more unique items ( that is one step closer to being an art piece than the commodity). However due to the fact that our state is in a constant flux, these items will over time be commodified.</p>
<p>Central to Darwin's theory of evolution is the phrase "survival of the fittest" the essence of which means the better a species is able to fit into its surrounding environment the higher the chance for its survival. If we consider these tools that we see made available in the market as an external manifestation of the human specie's attempt to better fit into our environment, we should observe that the speed at which the human specie evolve has been accelerating through the ages with the information age being the most rapid amongst them all:</p>
<p>Prehistoric age
Stone age
Bronze age
Iron age
Agrarian age
Industrial age
Electronic age
Information age</p>
<p>A further thought on the three cases I highlighted previously just occurred to me.  It might be possible that the more creative product alternative comes in built with ability to solve more problems than the generic product.</p>
<p><strong>Case One</strong></p>
<p>Increased productivity of company operations</p>
<p><strong>Case Two</strong></p>
<p>Guaranteed  ability to perform in more extreme environments such as outer space, the Artic north and the Antartic south.</p>
<p><strong>Case Three</strong></p>
<p>Ability to stay comfortable in more extreme environments such as outer space, the Artic north and the Antartic South. Another speculative use, though one which is highly questionable, is the ability to differentiate one relatively unmarked human from another in terms of technical expertise and access to resource. However due to the inherent inaccuracy caused by the human ego, the variance between what one does and how one dresses is subjected. A common example would be a person who has resource that allows him access to a $100,000 worth clothing item, decided to opt for a $10 clothing instead, while an idiot who aspires to <strong><em>look </em></strong>like the rich get himself into a debt of $100,000 for that relatively useless piece of clothing item instead of opting for the more practical $10.</p>
<p>In an age whereby more and more people proclaims that religion is no longer relevant, I counter propose that religion, more specifically defined as the link between us (who are relative) and the Great Spirit (that which is absolute) has became more important in this increasing rate of evolutionary flux.</p>
<p>I further propose that materialism, more specifically defined as the egotism of equating our personal identity to our profession and sometimes what we own (an ideological legacy from the agrarian &amp; industrial age), as a very dangerous approach to this state of evolutionary flux.</p>
<p>With the rapid rate of evolution happening within the human species, the rate of which new professions are created and existing professions become destroyed becomes faster. As such the rate at which resource is accessible to an individual human varies more across time in the information age as compared to the industrial or agrarian age. Ownership of items that consumes a constant rate of resource over time thus becomes infeasible if the rate of resource consumption is exceedingly huge.</p>
<p>The act of fixating on a dying profession or on an infeasible item ownership, both impractical, is an external manifestation of an ego that does not fit to the environment and hence lowers the chances of the being's survival in the long run.</p>
<p>In essence the mind is a miniature reflection of the great spirit that is around us. A good example is the ability of our mind to freely time travel (the forth dimension on top of the three dimensional world we see around us). I am speculating on the possibility of applying the ideas of quantum physiques to the link between the mind and the great spirit. There has been multiple literature (Carl Gustav Jung's included) that states the existence of a link between our subconscious mind and the collective mind(the great spirit). Hence it can be speculated that by discarding all fixations that occur in our conscious mind, there is a possibility of allowing the free follow of thoughts from our subconscious mind to our conscious mind. If the first item of my hypothesis is true (that our subconscious mind has a valid link to the great spirit), we would in essence be aspired to the absolute and hence achieve a higher rate of survival.</p>
