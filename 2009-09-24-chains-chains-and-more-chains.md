What a night! Alena who sat beside me on the bench was once again in tears. I watched her, not knowing what to feel. She seemed totally agreeable with the first two terms I set for our relationship but not the third.

**Term 1 : We will never ever have kids
***Secretly still I think she is coveting that I will have a change of hearts 5 to 6 years down the road. **Seriously **though I have no intentions at all of bring another child to this world only to be imprisoned by life immediately.* *Memories of my childhood behind locked doors and grilled bars and afternoon stuck bored brainless in school **are still vivid in my mind.*

**Term 2**** : We will never ever commit to the purchase of houses
***Was out with **Madelyn the other day, heard from her she and her husband just got themselves in a 30 year mortgage. I guess they should be old and immobile by the time they finish paying off their loans. My life out of prison has just started, I am a freeman!!! I don't really feel any motivations to head back in again for another 30 years of my life. ***
**

**Term 3**** : I will need to wander off alone for months
***A life of wandering is the ultimate symbolism of freedom in its purest essence**. Being restricted from such would be no different from a life of imprisonment, such a life is no life at all!***
**

I wonder how she would not come to see of it this way? What is the point of keeping me around always, when I will only get more grouchy and restless, causing more annoyance than good to those around me with my presence. My feet is begging for the taste of hitherto unwalked paths and the horizon beckons.

It seems like I have over the past few months dug out all the most unlikely haunts there are to be found on this tiny red dot and am almost to the extent of being able to memorize all the places like the back of my palm. It was so torturous. I just need some new playgrounds to get lost in.

Truth is recently, the sight of my family and Alena only reminds me of the invisible chains they have in their hands. Chains they unknowingly but inevitably will use on me. Chain which Alena aims to build using her tears and quarrels and my parents their constant nagging. Instinctly I felt threatened, very threatened. Even my visit to my relatives yesterday didn't help.

Oh yeah, this relative of mine was out with serious intent to do some brain washing. "????" *The fruit thus fallen soon becomes the root*. That was the four lettered gift she bestowed before I left. Prior to my departure, I agreed to have those four words written in my diary but nothing more. Quietly, I actually thought to myself she could go screw herself with that four word of hers. No offence but who is she to dictate how I should live my life. Just the thought of it left an extremely foul and pungent taste in my mouth.

Debts owing should be coming in over the next few weeks. I have finally put a curb to the two most massive drainage to my capital over the past 12 months, Alena and my parents.

I have paid my dues to my parents for the year at least and Alena is on the brink of starting her job in Singapore. Not that the pressure I exterted on her didn't help. One could look at it as cruel but I don't really feel the incentive to provide the fish forever. I don't run a charity organization. There is no such thing as a free lunch, or in  my case a constant free lunch. She has been feeling stressed recently from her job search. Hey tough life! too bad. Time for her to seriously get her kick together and move along.

Chains chains chains... All these chains, the time will soon come to drop them all. Lucky on the commercial side there are not much new bondages coming in. Good keep it that way. It will facilitate my shifting. Perhaps I am selfish, perhaps I am heartless. If such is the case, so be it. I only live once and I aim to live it!
