### Profile

 	- Founder of quantum fund

### Key take aways

 	- There is a gap between perception and reality

 	Its the distortion that shapes events
 	- Market participants operate with biases and these biases influence the course of events
 	- Market prices are always going to be wrong because its offers a biased view of the future
 	- biases works both ways
 	- biases are self reinforcing, overreaction happens
 	- boom and bust are attributed to the flux and uncertainty due to this gap
 	- since the market is always wrong if you follow everyone else, you will perform poorly

 	- On risk taking

 	Its alright to take risk
 	- When taking risk don't bet the ranch
 	- Once you know what the market is thinking, bet on the unexpected
 	- look for a sudden change in the market not yet identified by anyone else
 	- develop a thesis and test it on the market
 	- take a position where you have time on your side
 	- learn how to survive
 	- Attain superior long term returns through preservation of capital and home runs
 	- Its not whether you are right or wrong but how much you make when you are right and how much you lose when you are wrong

 	- On positions

 	be willing to endure the pain of following your logic when everyone else is going the other way
 	- pick the best and worst performers in an industry
 	- if your investment is going well, follow your instincts and go with all you've got

 	- To avoid

 	lopsided trend following is necessary to produce a violent market crash
 	- investors trying to influence prices by acquiring a large position in a currency will face disastrous results when position is sold

 	- At times gut feelings will need to override logical analysis
 	- gain access to world leaders for better insights
