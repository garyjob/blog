recently I have been working on integrating the pingback system with [Things To Do Singapore](http://thingstodosingapore.com). Seems like not all blogs allow for pingback. Apparently it is disable on blogspot by default. This is the target on [blogspot ](http://garionjob.blogspot.com/2009/07/testing-for-pingback.html)I am doing pingback on.

I think I will still need to do a few more days of testing for this to work in stable version.
