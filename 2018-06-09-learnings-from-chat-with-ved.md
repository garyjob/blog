### On Market Places

 	- The main challenge of scaling UpWork is the variability of the service

 	Lyft and Uber's model - getting you from point A to B
 	- UpWork connects you with contractor who does consulting work and the quality varies based on service provider

 	- Scaling a market place that is digital is easier than scaling one that is service based

 	border crossing is performed easily
 	- Uber spends a lot of money entering into each new territory because it is  building a new market place each time

 	- Performing Market Segmentation helps understand which segment is growing
 	- Growth is the new marketing

 	marketers which are focus on traditional channels of marketing will have a hard time transitioning to digital channels
 	- 1st principal approach to funnel analysis and conversion rates optimization

 	understand where they are dropping
 	- understand the user psychology behind why they are dropping off

### Elderly-care marketplace

 	- Founding approach

 	raised money from ex-colleagues
 	- founded team with 2 ex-colleagues

 	- UpWork is focused on the digital tasks while elderly care is an offline tasks

 	- Reasons for shutting down

 	well funded entrants
 	- real service is harder to scale than digital service
 	- quality variability of service provider
 	- difficulty in quantifying trust that can be translated from one customer to another - its a highly personal service
