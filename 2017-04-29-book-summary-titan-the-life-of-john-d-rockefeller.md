### Personal life

 	- Excessive reflection upon unpleasant but unalterable events only weakened one's resolve in the face of enemies
 	- Rockefeller was the sort of stubborn person who only grew more determined with rejection
 	- He took internal monitoring to an advanced stage. He scrutinized his daily activities and regulated his desires, hoping to banish spontaneity and unpredictability from his life. Whenever his ambition was about to devour him, his conscience urged restraint.
 	- Wealthy Cleveland businessmen have an understated style that he studied very attentively during his formative stage of his life - they went about their business without any display of power or money
 	- He possessed a sense of calling in both religion and business, with Christianity and Capitalism forming the twin pillars.
 	- A boy must ever be careful to avoid the temptations which beset him, to select carefully his associates and give attention as well to his spiritual, mental and material interests
 	- Humility: It is very important to remember what other people tell you, not so much what you yourself already know
 	- A natural leader: the more agitated others became, the calmer he grew
 	- Friendship founded on business is superior to friendship founded on business
 	- Love beautiful, useful things
 	- hates frills, affectations mere pretenses of something very fine
 	- To be fiercely revolutionary in business, he needed to be utterly conventional at home. Preferred staying at home instead of going to clubs
 	- Every hour was tightly budgeted and rigidly compartmentalized. Daily rituals helps deal with underlying tension
 	- We fail to achieve big things because we lack concentration - the art of concentration of the mind on the thing to be done at the proper time and to the exclusion of everything else
 	- Always a nod and kind word for everyone and never forgot anyone
 	- Control of self  wins the battle, for it means control of others

### Puritan influence

 	- making money and delivering value to the masses as the highest level of good one could do in the service of God

 	I believe it is my duty to make money and still more money, and to use the money for the good of my fellow man according to the dictates of my conscience

 	- Puritans had produced a religion that validated worldly activities, with the making of money by acquisition as the ultimate purpose of life.
 	- Tithing instill habits of thrift, self-denial and careful budgeting - all valuable assets for any aspiring capitalist
 	- Unlimited greed for gain is not identical with capitalism and is still less in spirit
 	- Capitalism may even be identical with the restraint, rational tempering of irrational impulses
 	- The man who would be rich must be thrifty
 	- He inhabited a stoic universe in which it was considered a sign of strength and mental health to banish your cares and forget ahead instead of morbidly dwelling on your parent's failings
