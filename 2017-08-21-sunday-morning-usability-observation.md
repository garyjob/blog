- User expects to see button just below forms
 	- User is confused when there is a mismatch between text describing what visual element should look like and the actual visual element
 	- When user is given instruction to go to a page and expect a visual element and that visual element is not visible user gets confused
 	- Amazon onboarding actually walks user through a few use cases and explicitly ask users to perform the steps within each use case. This facilitates the building of muscle memory
 	- Amazon displays back visual cue on what to do next if expected path is not working
 	- App Store: To ensure App is published for territory u are expecting users to operate in
 	- AreoMexico.com: disabled grayed out option did not provide sufficient visual indication that option was not available. Was expecting option to be described in legend section as other options
