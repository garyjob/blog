### Mistakes

 	- Do not hold a position against general macro events like (Trade) Wars

 	**Lesson learned:** impact of loss aversion and reversion to mean is muted when trade war is occurring

 	- Don't double down on your mistakes

 	**Lesson learned**: it is cheaper to admit mistake and cut losess

 	- Committing too much to a position leaving not much liquidity for later. This forces freeing up liquidity at a loss when new buying signals surface.

 	**Lesson learned**: it is cheaper to under allocate portfolio to a position upfront.

 	- Entering too late into a buy signal by more than 48 hours.

 	**Lesson learned**: it is cheaper to forget about it when you are late

 	- Entering too early into a buy signal.

 	**Lesson learned**: it is cheaper to figure out the support level before entering into position.

 	- Don't enter into position when there are no buy signals.

 	**Lesson learned**: it is cheaper to wait for a wave than to get carried away by the anxiety that there will never be a buy signal again in this lifetime.

 	- Not verifying assumptions

 	**Lesson learned**: Seek evidences to challenge your own assumptions. Lessons could be learned when you dig deeper into pass records to for deeper insights.

### Additional insights

 	- Sudden news about macro economic events (Donald Trump tweeting) does follow a lose aversion and reversion to mean pattern.
 	- Gradual news about macro economic events (US passing tariffs on China and banning Huawei) will have a long term negative impact.
 	- Price of REITs are:

 	relatively insensitive to trade wars
 	- hyper sensitive to Federal Reserve (expected) interest rate changes

 	- Only execute loss aversion and reversion to mean trades on positions that exhibit bullish trends both at the individual stock level as well as at the SnP level.
