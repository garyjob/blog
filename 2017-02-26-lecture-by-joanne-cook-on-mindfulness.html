<pre class="codehilite"><code>- 1980s trend of relapsing depression -

latent vulnerability to relapse: 50% for first timer,
- latent vulnerability to relapse: 75% for second timer onwards

- Medical confirmation

Rumination n planning good for evolution survival but not good for emotions
- Clinical Trails on three groups where non-control groups exhibited same effects

Control

- users of anti depressant

- Buddhist modernism

indigenous response to western science
- Compatibility of reformist Buddhism and science
- Seeing the Buddha as the first psychologist
- Presented as skill training n way of being
- Vipasana - is reformative buddhist practice

taught it to the lay people to help them to deal more easily with lay life
- Buddhism is bring interpreted as way of life and not religion facilitates this transition

- Political drive

Lord Richard Layard and Lord William's concern on the lack of compassion in health care
- All party parliamentary group in west minster
- To use her anthropological process to provide critic
- Report was written with proposed further area for research

Health, education, criminal Justice n work place

- Outcome: The mind became a sign for political focus - objectified

</code></pre>

<h2>Aspects of Mindfulness Learning in MBCT</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Cognitive - new frame work for self mind n depression
- Meta cognitive - relating to thoughts as thoughts. Cultivate desensitize perspective to thoughts. See rumination as is. Aka structured consciousness

Seeing thoughts are just thoughts - can choose how to react
- Distancing oneself from thought and looking at them instead of through them

- Attitudinal - friendly curiosity towards thoughts that goes through the mind

David Atinbra attitude towards self
- Friendly n curious
- Compassion
- Kindness
- Friendliness
- Acceptance
</code></pre>

<h2>Objectives of MBCT</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- A effective substitute from prolonged Anti depressant use
- We're looking for maintenance form of CBT
- Learning to shift underlying meta scheme about how people see themselves
- Developing awareness rather than acting on auto pilot
- Recognize subtle shifts in the body
- Practice how to move attention from one area to another
- Each time bad things happen bring attention back to body to understand how it actually feels in the body
- Build a Mind-gap
- Suspend commitment to thought
- To Shift from consciousness as part of thinking to thinking as part of consciousness
- Practitioners learn that Thoughts are not Facts
</code></pre>

<h2>Format on how MBCT is conducted</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- MBCT is very scripted

When frustrated invite to congratulate themselves of awareness of frustration
- Teacher constantly lace with invitation terms n encouragement towards kindly ways

- 8-12 people meet once per week 2 per week for 8 weeks
- Patients who had 3 or more episodes but are currently well
- Progressions:

Body scan,
- breathing,
- thoughts,
- space

- During meditation

Once realize the mind has wandered off, acknowledge that and bring it back to the breathe n abdomen

- In week 4 - learn about the **territory of depression**

Given list of negative works view and asked to see if any identify with any in the list
- These are symptoms of depression instead of truth
- Depressive people - easy trigger automatic ruminative negative thinking
- See them as mental events instead of thoughts
- Mental suffering is a result of mindlessness
- Once negative thinking starts its hard to stop - like Niagara falls

- Patients are not directly taught Buddhism
</code></pre>

<h2>Format on how MBCT theraphist are trained</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- MBCT Therapist training has loads of Buddhist training - Christina fieldman

Expected to go on Meditation retreat
- Learned about 8 path, 4 foundations
- Use the framework for their job and to communicate with their colleague
</code></pre>

<h2>Mindfulness versus Evangelical Christianity</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Evangelical Christianity:

Seek to experience intense emotional intimacy with god
- Paying attention to ones thought to identify gods words
- Prayer trains attention
- Trains to experience part of their mind as presence of God
- 
-

- Similarities

Thinking about thinking

- Differences

In MBCT Meta cognition is reward in itself
- Content of thought is not very important in MBCT versus Christian training
- MBCT learn to relate mind as mind an object versus Christian to achieve relation with god through changing contents of thought
</code></pre>

<h2>Further thoughts</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Readings of mindfulness as an ethical versus utility value
- What happens to transcendence n enlightenment?

Finding transcendence in the mundane?

Washing dishes for the sake of washing dishes

- important but is a gradual change and not a radical change

- The monastery as a boot camp?
- A society where it becomes common place?
- If u are witnessing u then where are u? U can really trip out!
</code></pre>

<h2>Further readings</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Book: Dark night of the soul: frightening experience of spiritual practice
- Book: The Buddha brain
- Book: mindful America - Mindfulness has step into the path of traditional spirituality
