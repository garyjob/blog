### From Tommaso on Machine Learning - Economics

 	- Study was done on Italy
 	- Voting patterns can be leading indicators for credit spread
 	- When a political party is stable, Eigen distance between votes of party members will cluster together, even for bills that are not critical for parties
 	- When a political party becomes unstable, the Eigen distance between vote on non-critical bills by party members will increase
 	- Alignment will increase before a wild swing to misalignment

 	periods of high alignment leads to very tight credit spread
 	- tight credit spread indicates a very high price for bond

 	- Misalignment will decrease before consolidation towards alignment

 	periods of low alignment leads to very wide credit spread
 	- wide credit spread indicates a very low price for bond

 	- proposed strategy:

 	when alignments increase, short bonds in anticipation for forthcoming misalignment
 	- when misalignments increase, long bonds in anticipation for forthcoming alignment

### From Tommaso on Machine Learning - Micro-biology

 	- Started studying how presence specific bacteria affects health at an aggregate level
 	- Studying ancestral tree of bacterias help estimate the distribution of bacteria in the gut of different individuals

### On sales

 	- Mormons are one of the best sales people due to their coming to age ritual.
 	- They typically will get rejected many many times during their passing through rite

### On human cyborgs

 	- Neil Harbisson is an artist who is color blind, he implanted a device into his brain which allows him to see colors

### On hardware and biotech with Andrew

 	- To design printed circuit board install IDE which allows easy assembly, simulation and coding - DesignSpark
 	- Firmware for micro-processors are written in C. Firmware controls where signals are past to when incoming signals are received
 	- Micro-processors are installed on circuit board
 	- Can be printed in China and shipped over in 5 days - PCBWay
 	- BioCurious and another biotech hacker space up in Berkeley have managed to train yeast to product cocaine and THC
