It was afternoon, everyone was out. Even the cat for once seemed to be missing. I was alone. Feeling bored of work, I found for myself Wong Kar Wai's movie "Chung King Express" over Veoh.com.

Suddenly, the sky broke and started pouring heavily. It was amazing how mother nature's mood could turn sour in a short span of an hour. A squall assailed the house leaving the interior disheveled in its wake. I was roused momentarily from my reverie in cyber space.

Back to the movie again...

It was a strange movie, 4 characters, one's relationship with the next down the line was one's ever being in close proximity to the other. A police officer sits alone in his house every evening talking to his furniture and belongings left behind by his ex-lover, oblivious to the slight furnishing changes to the house by his secret admirer whom herself steals into his apartment every afternoon. Sometimes he does notice the difference but attributes these to the house's change of mood over his departed ex-lover. It is really strange.

Another police offer goes running for the entire month leading up to his birthday after his breakup on April Fool's Day, obsessed with stocking up canned pine apple that expires exactly on the 1st of May, neither later nor earlier. Always making calls from in the evening from the same telephone in front of the same snack shop, coincidentally the same one the first visits.

Suddenly I received a text message from some stranger whom ask if I could talk. Thus I did, via skype.  He was looking for the wrong person. Skype requested that I review their quality of service. It was ironic but I was half tempted to rate it down. How is it possible to rate the quality of the call as excellent when the fact that this call that never should have happened ever did happen?

Thinking back to the conversation that took place once at night, I wonder if I would be suffer as did both police officers in the movie from neurosis. Fearing from the hurt that ensures should a final parting come to pass but threading forward nevertheless.
