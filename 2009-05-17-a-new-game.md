Recently I got commissioned to write a new game. The original version was supposed to be a hybrid form of the traditional monopoly game. However to avoid copyright problems we decided to tweak it. Hence the resulting board was a world map instead of a squarish shape group of grids in the old monopoly. 

It was very enjoyable writing that game as half the routes one it were ones I ever took while travelling. The mode of transport was quite interesting too. You could go by foot, car, train, ships and airballons from one city to another. The first 4 I have ever tried, the last one not as yet. I am damned looking forward to trying that one out one of these days. 

Just in case you might want to try it out you could go to where this game is currently resided. [fortune.name1price.com](http://fortune.name1price.com). It takes a while to load as it is quite big and complex.
