<p><strong>Chief Objective:</strong> Figure out how you can address their concerns and still get what you want</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- **Behavioral dos and don'ts**

Do not confuse personal desire for what needs to be done -

decide clearly is the one single goal you want to accomplish
- The narrower your request, the higher likelihood for success

- Do not assume receiving party would get angry or retaliate after receiving a proposition. Test all ideas and assumptions
- Do not discriminate or judge the motivations of people. Understand the mechanism and use them.
- The proposed value must appeal to the receiving party
- Do not assume other's will recognize what you see as true (or a better mouse trap) and simply give in
- Do not write off people who do not come to see things from your point of view as deficient
- Do not resent having to go out of your way to effect an influence
- Do not treat others as you would like to be treated, they may not have the same taste
- Allow others the opportunity to tell their *story*. It is possible to convey and understanding without a corresponding agreement
- Become aware of what makes you worked up

- **Context &lt;&gt; Attribution biases**

Organizational situation a person is in plays a much larger role than their own personality.
- Understand the language and jargon of the group
- Spend time to understand operating context
- Do not demonize or stereotype the other party:

leads to self fulfilling prophecy
- The pygmalion effect
- None cooperation is due to temporarily mismatch with currencies you can muster

- The way people are measured and rewarded shapes a lot of their behavior
- Areas with the highest level of task uncertainties gets the most attention
- Macro economic forces
- Micro economic forces
- Explain proposal in terms of costs and benefits to the recipients when possible

- **Currencies for exchange**

Inspiration related:

what vision can you share with them to inspire them?

- Task related:

what tasks can you help them accomplish?

- Position related:

what positional influence do you have that could help further their cause?

- Relationship related

rapport that was build up through constant contact

- Personal

Relationship established with person outside of working situation

- **Benefits of a good, open and trusting relationship**

Communication is more complete
- More open for influence
- More flexibility in terms of what currency to use to pay back

- **Trend toward knowledge based economy**

Bosses need to influence through the gaining of respect

- **Roles and inclinations**

Sales representatives
- Finance person
- Engineers
- Human resource personnel
