My binary testing result shows that there exist a critical threshold on the frequency of automated postings in Twitter which demarcates user perception on a piece of information between spamming and insignificant useful information.

Applying the Law of Entrophy to this equation, we define each hour non-activity in terms of no tweet as  a **0**, and each hour of activity in terms of one tweet as a **1.** Our objective is to determine the minimum amount of **0**s to preced a **1**, before that **1** can be perceived as a significant piece of useful information and thus not a spam.

The first configuration with the pattern **001** resulted in an average follower acquisition rate of **+1/**week. The current rate with the patter **00000000000000000000001** (*23x0 + 1x1*) resulted in an increase in average follower acquisition rate of **+5**/day.

I will leave this second pattern for the next two weeks before reducing a **0 **from the pattern. Thereafter I will measure the average follower acquisition rate.
