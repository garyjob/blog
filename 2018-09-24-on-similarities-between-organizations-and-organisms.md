An individual in an organization is similar to a cell in an organism.

The earlier the stage in the life cycle, the more generic and diverse the basic unit is. Founders and stem cells.

As maturity occurs, the basic unit becomes more specialized and in some cases loses ability that units in earlier stages had but is more adapted to performing its tasks. Stem cells can become bone cells but bone cells cannot become stem cells.

It is important to keep in mind that every organization and organism has a inherent DNA that will inevitably express itself.

Micheal Porter states an organization should not measure its success by its size but by how fit it’s configuration is in terms of serving its purpose. Charles Darwin’s survival of the fittest posits that the organism most suited for its environment will be the one that flourishes in that environment. In none of these two statements were there mention of size as an advantage.

Regarding cells and individuals, there comes a time in the life cycle of the organism/organization when the cell dies off and the individual departs.
