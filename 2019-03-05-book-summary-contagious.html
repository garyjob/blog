<h3>On Word of mouth</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- versus advertising

it is more persuasive since the messenger has no monetary incentive and is a trusted person.
- It is directed at the immediate context of the recipient

- Only 7% of word of mouth happens online. Most still happens offline
- Types of word of mouth

immediate word of mouth
- ongoing word of mouth

- Big forest fires aren't caused by big sparks. Lots of individual trees have to catch fire and carry the flame
</code></pre>

<h3>Word of mouth principles</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Social currency

people want to feel special about themselves. When they get to share something extraordinary, they get the chance to Wow others.
- Categories of currency

scarcity
- exclusivity

- Triggers

Ideas strongly associated with items frequently found the environment gets triggered more often. Pick common objects in a user's environment that is not already laced with other meanings.
- The more specific a trigger the higher the likelihood of triggered action.
- Choose trigger right close to the proximity of the intended action

- Emotions

Emotions that excites will be more likely to drive the recipient towards an action than those that.

Useful emotions: Awe, excitement, anger, fear
- Not useful emotions: sadness, hopelessness

- Associate the idea with emotions

- Public

Monkey see, monkey do. Figure out how to make users activities more visible to those around them so that they could copy his action. A private action is unlikely to get copied
- Choose stimulus that others can't help but notice.

- Practical Value

Useful things tends to get shared more frequently. While there might be less initial word of mouth, there will always be on going word of mouth.

- Stories

help transfer huge amounts of contextual information to recipient
- helps suspending judgement - using proof by analogy
- story must be designed such that storyline falls apart when intended idea is removed from it
- For dramatic purposes, interesting and novel points often get exaggerated as story pasts from one person. As such the story gets more and more remarkable as it is past along.
