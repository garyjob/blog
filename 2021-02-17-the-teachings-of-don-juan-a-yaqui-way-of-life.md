#### Shamanic world view

The practitioner of the shamanic tradition at once sees the world as it is as well as a manifestation of infinite energy that is is constant flux.
#### The sequence of four enemies a knowledge seeker must inevitably face

 	- **Fear:** The fear of uncertainty and the unknown is the first enemy a knowledge seeker must face. As he progresses along his journey, he will be faced with fear over an over again. The work is to face the fear and keep moving forward in the question for knowledge. With time, this fear will dissipate and he will get clarity
 	- **Clarity**: Clarity is a subtle enemy. Succumbing to this enemy means the inability to decipher real clarity from one's egotistical illusion. The work is to constantly question the perceive clarity while moving forward in the quest for knowledge. With time comes true clarity which brings with it a lot of power
 	- **Power**: Power is a very seductive enemy. With great power comes the temptation to abuse this power. Succumbing to this enemy brings around rampant destruction due to abusive use of power. The work is to constantly keep power in check while continuing the pursuit and application of knowledge. With time, comes the final enemy, old age.
 	- **Old age**: Is an enemy that can only be conquered temporarily. The work is to constantly fight the desire to lie and rest. Yielding to this enemy will result in no further pursuit and application of the knowledge acquired.

#### Noteworthy plants

 	- **Jimson weed**: Psychedelic to help you relive and see your past memories
 	- **Peyote**: Another plant to aid in the communion with the spirits
 	- **Mescalito**: Hallucinogenic drug made from the flowering heads of cactus
