## Key take aways

- Create X dollar of value for the world and capture Y% dollar of value for yourself
X and Y are independent variables

- Google - relatively smaller market but **profit margins are great**. Accumulates so much cash year or year- Airlines - large market but **profit margin are shit**. Companies go bankrupt often in that market
- Companies are either operating in perfect competition or in monopolies. Nowhere in between. Avoid markets where you have a lot of competition- The last mover advantage: 
Proprietary technology needs to be 10X of the closest substitute

- Gain monopoly and maintain monopoly in that market segment as it grows in size- ability to have durability in a sector is more important than growth rate since the bulk of the revenue is really really far in the future
- As a startup it is important 
you want to start in markets that are so** small** it has almost no value and people don't notice. - It becomes really easy to saturate the market to establish a brand- You want to be a one of a kind company in that small market versus a company in a very large market with lots of competitors it is hard to differentiate
- You want to figure out how to expand that market after you have saturated it- Monopoly characteristics
Software - Google, Facebook, Amazon
Economics of scale- Network effects
- Vertically integrated complex monopolies - Tesla, SpaceX, Standard Oil
Very capital intensive to build- Very complex coordination- Not easy to convince investors to fund to build

- Avoid the psychological blindspot where you think competition is a form of validation
While competition gets you better at doing something- Too much competition is not profitable
- Other thoughts
Skeptical about lean startup methodology- By the time you figure everything out the competition has came. There is always a risk element to going into unknown terrain- Asperger syndrome
people who have high conviction and uneasily swayed very introverted- versus Harvard people who are super-extroverted and low level conviction
