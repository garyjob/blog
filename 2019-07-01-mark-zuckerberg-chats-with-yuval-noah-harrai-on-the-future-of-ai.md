### Key take aways

 	- Spread of inequality where some countries have the ability to harness AI while others don't
 	- AI based recommendation systems moving from being just an oracle to becoming a sovereign
 	- AI as a tool is an amplifier

 	concerns that it will benefit totalitarianism more than democracy leading to totalitarianism becoming a more favorable governance model worldwide
 	- surveillance
 	- psychological manipulation - the inability to know your true self through your thoughts
 	- what happens if morality and expediency diverge when it comes to governance

 	- Effectiveness of curbing the negative effects of AI by encoding values within policy frameworks governing these AI based systems

 	Companies based in Democratic countries will encode democratic values within their systems vice versa for Totalitarian countries

 	- Personalization versus Fragmentation

 	when everyone in a country chooses his own community that is mainly online there is no longer a glue holding the local community together

 	- Long term versus short term

 	The long term benefits might come sooner than expected when taking a short term trade off
