- Balance and counter balance / Yin and Yang

 	history is a vast early warning system, Norman Cousin
 	- the further forward you want to see the further back you need to look
 	- to sing high, you need to sign really low
 	- the higher the ups you want to go, the deeper the lows
 	- the further the arrow you want to shoot, the further back you need to pull

 	- Economics

 	game theory and local proximity optimization ( hill climbing algorithm) locks you in to a specific local proximity
 	- the outliers that don’t have to deal with this legacy will always find the higher hill top
 	- core versus crowd - learning at the fringes does not always get to the core

 	- seeing relationship through tainted lens

 	prevents the  ability to see resources that are available to enhance the experience
 	- examples

 	damsel in distress
 	- knight in shining armor

 	- prevents the ability to explore new potential possibility
