 	- As a CEO, being in the trenches feels a lot like being punched in the face over and over again
 	- A lot of dysfunctions in teams boils down to not being clear about roles and responsibilities
 	- always talk about the task and not about the person
 	- The (blame of the screw up) Buck stops with the CEO whose role and responsibility includes being the ultimate decision maker
 	- It is the CEO’s job to bring up difficult conversations that are necessary
 	- performance issues boil down to two types motivational, perceived or ability

 	motivation because feeling burned out
 	- perceived because role n responsibility not clear
 	- ability then not supposed to clear  skillset mismatch
