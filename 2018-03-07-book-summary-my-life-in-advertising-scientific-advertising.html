<p>**Causes of most business/advertising failure **</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- over-reaching
- reckless speculation on a hidden chance
- fear of losing out to some rival who might get farther or higher
</code></pre>

<p><strong>to become successful</strong></p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- learn deeply about human nature
- talk frequently to ordinary people

ignore the managers or the board of directors - they have distorted views

- to unlearn unpractical things learned in colleague
- we do best what we like best
- make test to feel out public pulse

do not venture too far on personal opinion
- submit all things to public opinion

- sell them what they need not what you desire

ask a person to take a chance on him instead of you

- the greatest winnings in happiness, money or content have been accomplished amid almost universal scorn

the average man is not successful so why let majority rule in matters affecting our lives

- stay away from exaggerations
- when something works stick to it

most experiments fail
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Human nature</strong></p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- curiosity - especially women

give actual numbers to impress
- these numbers often appear mundane to the practitioners but not the end consumers
- do not exaggerate

claims like best in the world cause you to be discounted

- give them a face - people like to deal with men whose names are connected with certain accomplishments
- prevention not popular as cure
- fundamental desires

more success
- more happiness
- more beauty
- more cheer
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Salesmanship</strong></p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- know what buyers are thinking about and what they are coming to want - get familiar with the trend to be a leader in a winning trend
- style is a handicap -

remove anything that takes attention from the subject
- causes people to be wary

- get a name that tells a story
- focus on the end consumer

and for a while ignore the intermediaries - their concerns will distract you away from actual customer needs
- win consumers and let them sell to dealers and jobbers

- only give samples to people who request it and not those that dont

get feedback after giving out samples

- repeat sales is easier than new sales
- once a plan is proven to be right and safe ramp up on volume quickly
- use keyed coupons to know which channels convert the nest
- feel the way, don't rely on judgement or experience

new problems require new experience
- test our undertakings in the most exact way possible
- learn our mistakes and correct them

- use their own language to speak to them
- avoid wastage

use shortest most ordinary looking words possible - use words that convince
- don't take attention away from product to yourself
- images are space expensive

- fulfill existing needs is cheaper than educating new needs
- articulate the impressive which appears mundane to those in the know but not known to those not told
- ask for immediate action
