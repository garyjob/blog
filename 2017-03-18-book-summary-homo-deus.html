<p>On advancement</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Max Planck - science advances one funeral at a time. When one generation passes away do new theories have a chance to root out old ones
</code></pre>

<p>On happiness</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Epicurus:

outlined an entire ethic of dos and don'ts to guide people to along the treacherous path to happiness
- Despite our unprecedented achievements in the last few decades, its far from obvious that contemporary people are significantly more satisfied than their ancestors

- Life sciences:

happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations
- We never react to events in the outside world
- but only to sensations in our own bodies
- depression is a kind of unpleasant bodily sensation
- our biochemistry adapted to increasing our chances of survival and reproduction, not our happiness
- biochemical system rewards actions conducive to survival and reproduction with pleasant sensations

Food
- mates
</code></pre>

<p>Studying History</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Aim: Loosening the the grip of the past
- Enables us to notice possibilities that our ancestors could not or did not want us to imagine
- It does not tell us what to choose
- it gives us more options, to image alternative destinies
</code></pre>

<p>Agricultural deal:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Farmers justify their exploitation of domesticated animals in the name of new theist religions
</code></pre>

<p>Body is an algorithm</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Body feels hunger, fear, trembling
- He experiences a storm of sensations, emotions and desires
- These are nothing but the process of calculation
</code></pre>

<p>Individual versus Group</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Large numbers of people behave in a fundamentally different way than do small numbers
</code></pre>

<p>Sunk Cost Bias and Meaning</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- We want to believe our lives have some objective meaning
- our sacrifices matter to something beyond the stories in our head
- Meaning is created when many people weave together a network of stories
</code></pre>

<p>Non-material entities / religion</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- An entity is real if it can suffer
- religion / belief system is a tool for governing defined by its social function
- confers superhuman legitimacy on human laws, norms and values
- legitimates human social structures
- Asserts we are subjected to a system of moral laws that we did not invent
- Helps the state collect taxes without itself lifting a finger
- regulations on biochemical pursuit of happiness

good drugs - strengthen political stability, social order and economic growth
- bad drugs - threatens stability and growth
</code></pre>

<p>Religion versus Spiritualism</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Religion seeks to cement the worldly order
- Spirituality seeks to escape it
- Spiritual wanders most important obligation is to challenge the belief and conventions of dominant religion - Zen Buddhism &quot;If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Transition from Religion to Humanism</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- From What God/central authority said is true
- What you feel is true. Its far more important to know what you think about these matters
- Assumes each human has a single authentic inner self
- The central question is if *human can choose his desire in the first place*
- Transcranial simulators has proven to be able to alter human consciousness, resulting in enhanced capabilities
- The divide between the Identifying self versus the Experiencing self

Decisions are made by the Identifying self that functions without the ability to have comprehensive data
</code></pre>

<p>Modernity, the rat race and technology</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- In the capitalist world, the lives of the poor improve only when the economy grows
- Despite all our achievements, we feel a constant pressure to do and produce even more
- every generation destroys the old world and builds a new one in its place
- Continued belief in the growth story that is being supported by belief in the hi-tech Ark
</code></pre>

<p>Hi-tech Ark</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- is currently one of the biggest threats to the future of man and its eco-system
- Humans are in danger of loosing their economic value because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness
- Automation

Types of job

Agricultural
- Industry
- Services

- The coming technology bonanza can probably feed all humans. But without something to do humans will go crazy
- AI which first starts out as an Oracle will eventually turn into sovereign
</code></pre>

<p>Forthcoming Techno religions:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Techno-humanism

technology enhanced humans: cyborgs

- Data-religion

having enough data means knowing what to ignore
- machine can know us better than ourselves
- organisms are really just algorithms
- Intelligence versus consciousness
</code></pre>
