            <p>It was Machiavellic of me.  However being unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of absolutely contradictory information from two unfamiliar parties, not knowing who to trust and faced with the need to move progress forward, I saw no other alternatives than to force a show down between the two of them. (aka do a back burn and then throw a bomb into the main fire so that it runs out of fuel immediately). The drama concluded today and the truth was revealed. I managed to find out both sides of the story and put them together in one comprehensive piece.</p>
<p>If only all such scenarios were so easy to settle. Right at home is one such case, which I have been working on that till today has yet been resolved. Damn family politics! Guess that explains why I devote most of my time and effort to work of some kind. It is simple and utterly rewarding just like what Pasha said one night during supper. A good day's work gives you a  "YEAH! I kicked ass!" kinda feeling.</p>
<p>Start of next week, I will need to put what I have been doing thus far aside and really start focusing on working up the business plan with Ben and his team, if we are to even to expect any funding prior to the start of our project. The app challenge will be starting officially in the month of January and I still haven't done much shit on our mobile apps. I seriously wanna nail that competition and get our application showcased in quite a few technological and trade conventions as they claimed would be the case for winners.</p>
<p>However before that we will need to figure out the logistics, we are dealing with two time zones over here thankfully US is 16 hours behind which means 8 hours ahead in a typical day, so we could conference during mornings in Singapore and evenings in San Francisco. This is gonna be big, if not, then its gonna be a big flop Texan style.</p>
<p>Contrary to conventional practises, while most love to brag about their victories, I rather love more the idea of bragging about my failures. There more to be gained from in failures than there are in victories. Lessons learned from victories will soon be forgotten while lessons learned from failures will linger on for years.</p>
