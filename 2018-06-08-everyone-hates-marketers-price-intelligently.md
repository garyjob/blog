Market research is important. Need to think about it constantly
## Steps

### Step 1: Retention

 	- start with 10 users make them really really happy

 	measure based on retention and engagement metric

 	- find more people like them as make them really happy

### Step 2: Monetization

 	- Build the buyer persona
 	- quantify the use cases by assessing how much users are willing to pay for each use case
 	- Focus on value perception standpoint versus usage standpoint

 	someone might use a feature a lot but that feature is not very important
 	- invoicing feature in accounting software highly used but less valuable that analytics

 	- Customer development need to happen on at least a quarterly cadence
 	- send out surveys since it’s really cheap to send out surveys

 	Collect user data to validate hypothesis

 	- experiment with price every 6 months

### Acquisition

 	- work to figure out the acquisition channels as a startup
 	- larger companies really need to figure out how to monetize more existing companies
