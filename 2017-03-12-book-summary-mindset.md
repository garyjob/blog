Character is what allows you to reach the top and stay there

 	- None of them thought they were special
 	- They worked hard
 	- Keep their focus under pressure
 	- Stretched beyond their ordinary abilities when they had to

Take charge of the processes that brings and maintain success

People who have fixed mindset count on their talent to carry through.

 	- they consider themselves finished products
 	- They feel the need to protect themselves
 	- and blame
 	- They do everything but take charge of the process to grow
 	- Avoid the somebody/nobody syndrome

Success is a team sport

 	- It maybe one person's name on the record but takes an entire team that make its possible

Self-confidence and hubris

 	- There's only a razor's edge between self confidence and hubris

 	- Beware of success, it can knock you into a fixed mindset - the I won because I have talent attitude
 	- You never stay the same, you can either go one way or the other

CEOs and the Big Ego

 	- History

 	Prior to Iacocca's rise to prominence

 	CEO is a buttoned-down organization man
 	- well treated
 	- well paid
 	- essentially bland
 	- characterless

 	- After his rise to prominence

 	Fixed-mindset executives started vying for those labels
 	- CEOs became super herods
 	- People who preen their self egos are not the same people who foster long-term corporate health

 	- Fixed Mindset executives

 	The CEO becomes the main thing people worry about rather than reality being the primary reality
 	- Instead of learning, growing and moving the company forward
 	- It starts with the boss being worried of being judged and it ends up with everyone being worrying about being judged
 	- It breeds group thinking

 	- Growth Mindset executives

 	Lou Gerstner CEO of IBM
 	- Opened up the channels of communication up and down the company
 	- Create ways to foster alternative views and constructive criticism

 	- Ability is changeable and can be developed
 	- Experts in the field now believe that negotiating is a dynamic skill that can be cultivated and developed over a lifetime

On Relationships

 	- A no-effort relationship is a doomed relationship
 	- it takes word to communicate accurately
 	- it takes work to expose and resolve conflicting hopes and beliefs
 	- They ***worked** *happily ever after
 	- Choosing a partner is like choosing a set of problems
 	- Change from a *judge-and-be-judged* framework to a *learn-and-help-learn* framework

On False growth mindset

 	- People take what they like about themselves and call it a "growth mindset"
 	- There is a difference between being flexible/open-minded to being dedicated to growing a talent
 	- Couples who shifted from fixed mindset to growth mindset during counseling when sliding back into the fixed mindset again experience fiercer than ever bickering resulting from disappointed hopes

New research

 	- The brain is more like a muscle
 	- It changes and gets stronger when you use it
 	- Scientist have been able to show how the brain grows and gets stronger when you learn

Personal Insecurities

 	- many People with fixed mindset understand their cloak of specialness was really a suit of armor they built to feel safe, strong and worthy
 	- earlier on it may have protected them
 	- later on it constricted their growth
 	- sent them into self-defeating battles
 	- cut them off from satisfying mutual relationships

On Child rearing

 	- Communicate that feats of intellect or physical prowess are not all you care about
 	- Help them love the idea that they have to work every day for some little gain in skill or knowledge
