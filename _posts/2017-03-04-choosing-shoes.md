To check for:

 	- Match of in sole arch with actual foot - too high an arch would result in strain on knees and hips as body tries to compensate the pain felt by the sole
 	- stability of sole's outer rim to prevent accidental spraining of ankle outwards
 	- traction under heel to prevent outwards shifting of heels

Model bought:

 	- Fila Forward 2
 	- Running type
 	- Big 5 Sporting goods
 	- USD 27.25 after tax
