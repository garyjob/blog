While sending a personal email to each individual user who directly uses our API just now, it occurred to me the main difference between talking with someone you have relationship with (like your mum/girlfriend/wife...?) versus simply doing a mass email blast to a group of "strangers", is the potential lack of warmth and empathy in the latter on the sender's side.

No one really likes being treated like a number on a Excel sheet. It sucks.

The key challenge becomes how do you scale your communication as the amount of people you need to communicate with increases without alienating them. Or does it even matter?
