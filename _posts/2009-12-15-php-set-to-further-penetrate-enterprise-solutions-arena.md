**What is Enterprise Application?**
Enterprise Applications are software which provides business logic support functionality for an enterprise, typically in commercial organizations, which aims to improve the enterprise’s productivity and efficiency.

**Characteristics of enterprise software:**
Characteristics of enterprise software are performance, scalability, and robustness. Enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software.

Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools such as online shopping and online payment processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, content management, CRM, ERP, Business Intelligence, HR Management, Manufacturing, EAI etc.

**What is Scalability?**
There are a number of different aspects of scalability. It always starts with performance, code maintainability, fault tolerance, and the availability of programming staff.

**Why people has negative impression that PHP is only for small scale web-sites?**
PHP is a language for the rapid development of dynamic Websites. It also has many features that are friendly to beginning programmers, such as the fact that it doesn’t require variable declarations. However, many of these features can lead a programmer inadvertently to allow security holes to creep into a Web application. The popular security mailing lists teem with notes of flaws identified in PHP applications, but PHP can be as secure as any other language once you understand the basic types of flaws PHP applications tend to exhibit.

PHP is an open source programming language that is widely popular on the web. However because PHP so popular in shared hosting environments, many people have an impression that PHP is only for small scale web-sites. This is patently untrue, and PHP is in use in many large scale web sites such as [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/), [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and Lufthansa Online Ticketing for the creation of large web applications such as [IMP](http://horde.org/imp/).

Enterprises want to have specific assurances about a web technology they use in the following areas:

	- performance and fast development
	- reliability and security
	- extensibility – able to use industry standards to communicate with other software systems.
	- scalability – able to add additional servers as the load increases.
	- load balancing – ability to distribute the load so no single server is overloaded
	- high availability – ability to survive failure of server components transparently.

**Conclusion:**
To achieve high performance and scalability – it not only depend on language, it also depend on the developers.
