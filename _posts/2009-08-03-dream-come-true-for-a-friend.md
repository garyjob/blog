Sateesh my buddy has come a really long way for the [MBA challenge](http://mba.mindneurons.net/?p=4). I am proud and glad to have had the chance to help him out during this period of time. Buddy you will always have my support. Come to think of it the format of this competition really reminds me of my time doing my technopreneurship minor in NUS. It is always good to crack my brains. Haha
