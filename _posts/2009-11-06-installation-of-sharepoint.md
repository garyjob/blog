After talking with Satheesh for a while, i have decided that I should install Microsoft Sharepoint and attempt to play around with the technology to familiarize myself with it for future hacks.

Sadly my laptop could not support it. Ouch! The minimal requirement is a IIS 6.0 which means a Windows XP 64bit. Mines a Windows XP 32bit. I prefer this versus the Windows Vista which is currently in the market.

Meanwhile I guess I will be either shopping for a laptop or a desktop.

Am looking at something like the below

	- Minimum 2 Ghz
	- 4 GB RAM
	- 320 GB HDD

Once acquired this should be a good developement environment powerhouse to deal with this mamoth microsoft technology.
