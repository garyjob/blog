**Man and our environment**

 	- Imposing mental model on nature does not necessarily yield optimal output
 	- when something does not match our learned aesthetic, we assume it's wrong
 	- avoid unnecessary work

 	work is complete when nothing else necessary can be removed from it

 	- demonstrate with action instead of giving a hundred explanations
 	- farmer's state of mind is more important than growing technique

 	focus on growing food you need and less for commercial gains - an unstable proposition
 	- increasing scale of operation saps body and spirit

 	- fruit in slightly shrived state is holding its respiration and energy consumption down to the lowest possible level

**move towards spiritual awareness**

 	- yesterday's competitive edge becomes todays necessity -

 	no one can win
 	- everyone works longer hours for no ultimate gains as a result

 	- avoid extravagance
 	- avoid the ego trap of bigger, better and more challenging - optimize for free time
 	- fear of death results from clinging to life as it inevitable passes and changes
 	- Food and medicine are the same
 	- when you no longer want to eat something tasty, you can taste the real flavor of whatever you are eating

**Small garden favorites**

 	- lettuce
 	- bush beans
 	- spinach
 	- carrots
 	- peppers
