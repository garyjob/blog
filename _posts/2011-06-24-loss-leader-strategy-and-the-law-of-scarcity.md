Ironically, my attempts to save cost for clients by consulting with them and thereafter mapping their requirements to existing open source components seems to have the opposite effect occasionally.

The notion of cost savings they acquire during the consultant sessions inevitably leads to stimulation of their imagination. This is often followed by increase in proposed project scope which ultimately causes project costing to blow out of their budget range.

What needs follow thereafter is a process of reining their over stimulated imagination tying their infinite wants back to the resources they have available.

The morale of the story: Humans tend to have infinite wants however the law of scarcity inevitably rules.
