### Types of borrowers

 	- Hedge borrowers - cashflow can pay both debt and interest
 	- Speculative borrowers - cashflow can pay only interest. Needs to regularly refinance to repay debt
 	- Ponzi borrowers - believes future appreciation can finance both debt and interest

Crash happened when too high a percentage of borrowers in the system are Ponzi borrowers.
