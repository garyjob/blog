I tried to convert a video from VOB format to AVI format. It took me quite a while. This is because there are so many different softwares around and most of them at first appear to be free but attempts to **force payment **from the users when users really try to do any video coversion.

Eventually I came across this post [http://tigredefogo.blogspot.com/2007/05/tutorial-how-to-convert-dvd-vob-mpeg-2.html](http://tigredefogo.blogspot.com/2007/05/tutorial-how-to-convert-dvd-vob-mpeg-2.html). It was a life saver. I managed to download the version of  [VirtualDub  MPEG-2](http://fcchandler.home.comcast.net/stable/VirtualDub-MPEG2.zip) that can edit Mpeg 2 files. as well as the necessary codec [AC-3  ACM Codec.

Once done I not only could VOB files to AVI files without stupid watermarks, I could also indicate the exact range of frames (time in minutes and seconds) to include for conversion.

Pasha did recommened it to me before. But I guess the version i  downloaded was not extensive enough and I did  not configure it  properly too. Anyways two thumbs up for Virtual Dub!
