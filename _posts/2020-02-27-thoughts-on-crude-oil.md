### General overview

 	- Upstream exploration companies are heavily leverage. When attempting to trade on crude oil opt to trade hold position directly in the commodity as opposed to the companies operating within the sector
 	- Supply side economics

 	- Cost of production

 	Off shore rig lifting cost: USD 20/barrel
 	- Shale oil lifting cost: USD30/barrel
 	- Saudi Arabia lifting cost: USD2.80/barrel

 	- Demand side

 	China is one of the largest consumption of crude oil. Carbon Monoxide levels can be used as a proxy to estimate consumption
 	- Federal reserve interest rate cut to facilitate economic growth and expansion

### Event types

 	- Downwards pressure

 	Events that impede the free flow of goods and global demand apply downwards pressure on price

 	Jan 2020 Corona scare (Company versus Mother Nature)
 	- Dec 2018 US/China trade war escalation (Government versusGovernment )

 	- Events that flood the world with oil apply downwards pressure on price

### Trading approach

 	- Establish presence of bullish/bearish trend by observing MACD line in 5D/1M/3M view
 	- Buy OILU when  90 day MACD trend turns bullish or bullishness gains momentum
 	- Sell when OILU when 90 day MACD bullish trend losses momentum
 	- Buy OILD when 90 day MACD trend turns bearish or bearishness gains momentum
 	- Sell OILD when 90 day MACD bearish trend reverse losses momentum
 	- Exit OILD when WTI price drops below USD45
 	- Exit OILU when WTI price rises above USD60
 	- Enter OILU when

 	WTI USD40-45/barrel - when no deliberate flooding by OPEC+
 	- WTI USD26/barrel - when deliberate flooding by OPEC+

### Observations on employing trading approach

 	- Deliberate market making activities by operator to balance funds on OILD and OILU is disadvantageous for trading.
 	- Correlations of ETF prices to actual WTI prices is delayed
 	- The bulk of the price action occurs pre-market and post-market during time slots where placement of position is not possible
 	- Delays are observed between placing and filling of orders
