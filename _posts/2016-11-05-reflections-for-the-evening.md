Feelings of boredom on closer inspection was actually back and neck muscle aches in disguise.

When in noisy parties avoiding any form of serious conversation helps improve overall level of joy

walking around in crowded places is not enjoyable. Half the time is spent avoiding body collision.

Less thinking and more sensing is also really good. Sense the rhythm of the music. Sense where the body wants to move. Nothing to gain, nothing to lose just enjoy the flow. Forget the self.
