## Types of Risk

### Process risks

 	- Definition Risk: Solving the wrong problem
 	- Scope Creep: Some projects are just big
 	- Complexity Risk: big projects have lots of edge cases
 	- Over-precision: Unwarranted or excessive certainty
 	- Priority Risk: Fluctuating relative importance
 	- Technical Risk: Code is basically a thousands of implicit assumptions despite best efforts to describe all possible corner cases
 	- Dependency Risk: Big projects stretch our coordination ability

### Product risks

 	- Behavioral Risk: Customers don't behave they way you expect
 	- Market Risk: External factors shape customer needs

### People risk

 	- HiPPO Risk: Some decisions are made top-down when management does not understand actual ground situation
 	- Staffing Risk: Single point of failure, bus factor
 	- Impatience and Pressure: Sometimes we really want to be done so we take short cuts
 	- Ruinous Empathy: we are awfully nice to our colleagues, even when data states otherwise
 	- Stubbornness: we persist in making wrong decisions despite facts and reason stating otherwise
 	- Relationship Risk: My Team will hate me for making an unpopular decision that is correct
 	- Reputation Risk: This decision will impact my career
 	- Focus: Everything feels important

## Causes

Humans are terrible at accessing risk

 	- Survival bias
 	- Availability bias
 	- Recency bias
 	- Anchoring bias
 	- Loss aversion - gains and losses asymmetry

## Managing risk

 	- Work hard and know your customers
 	- Agonizing is expensive: time taken to agonize over which option of two is correct might be more than the actual time to validate the correctness of both options
 	- Recognizing you are not running a closed system

 	product change influences behavioral change
 	- behavioral change influences product change
 	- behavioral change is also influenced by

 	competition
 	- economic conditions
 	- pop culture trends
 	- customer familiarity
 	- Novelty
 	- Brand sentiment

 	- Best ideas are not measurable

 	There is only a small intersections between Provable and Correct
 	- True opportunity lies is usually Correct but not Provable

 	- Heuristics

 	**Focus**: Decide what actually matters
 	- **Agility**: Reach quickly to new information
 	- **Ambition**: Chase big opportunities
