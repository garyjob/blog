### White paper outlines:

 	- Headline or working title: You don’t have to settle on a headline or title right away, but start with a working version that describes your topic.
 	- An executive summary: This is essentially a brief (200 words or so) description of what your white paper will be about. Think of it like a short pitch for why someone should write what you’re about to write.
 	- Your introduction: Which points will you touch on in your intro? These are what you’ll expand on in the body of your white paper.
 	- Section sub-headings: Like your headline, these don’t need to be final yet. But, you should have a clear idea of what you’ll discuss in each section. If your headline is the core problem you’ll solve, consider each sub-heading a sub-point or step toward resolving it.

Subsections
Beneath each sub-heading, include further bullet points clarifying exactly what you’ll write about. This is all about knowing what you want to say before you try to say it.

 	- Sidebars: White papers often include sidebars or breakout boxes with additional information or data tables, like what you’d find in a magazine. In each section, list any possible sidebar ideas you might have. This could include any research or data you’ll need to find (more on this in a bit).

 	- Conclusion: Summarize your key takeaways. If it’s appropriate, you might consider adding a call-to-action here, too.

### Case Study outlines:

 	- Introduction

 	Identify the key problems and issues in the case study.
 	- Formulate and include a thesis statement, summarizing the outcome of your analysis in 1–2 sentences.

 	- Background

 	Set the scene: background information, relevant facts, and the most important issues.
 	- Demonstrate that you have researched the problems in this case study.

 	- Alternatives

 	Outline possible alternatives (not necessarily all of them)
 	- Explain why alternatives were rejected
 	- Constraints/reasons
 	- Why are alternatives not possible at this time?

 	- Proposed Solution

 	Provide one specific and realistic solution
 	- Explain why this solution was chosen
 	- Support this solution with solid evidence
 	- Concepts from class (text readings, discussions, lectures)
 	- Outside research
 	- Personal experience (anecdotes)

 	- Recommendations

 	Determine and discuss specific strategies for accomplishing the proposed solution.
 	- If applicable, recommend further action to resolve some of the issues
 	- What should be done and who should do it?
