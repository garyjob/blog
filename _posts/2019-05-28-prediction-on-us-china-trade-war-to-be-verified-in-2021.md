### Main points of contention

 	- Marxist ideological foundation versus a Judeo-Christian philosophical foundation

 	“In god we trust” versus a centrally controlled and designed market model
 	- China's inability to open up markets internationally due to challenges in finding a sustainable way to separate market from government
 	- viewing the Party as above the market leading to difference in way IP ownership is viewed

 	- The Chinese dream versus the American dream

 	China's dumping strategy which lead to the severe imbalance of trade and thus steady US job losses over the past years
 	- China's strategy of acquiring US technology via forceful knowledge transfer due to its point of view on markets which resulted in the blacklisting of Huawei
 	- China’s intention to establish leadership over two thirds of the world's population thus challenging US dominance leading to the election of a hawkish US president

### Assessment of situation

 	- The issue is deeply structural and resolution will be unlikely during Trump's current term of service
 	- Companies within impacted industries will continue experiencing negative headwinds well beyond 2019
 	- US companies will gradually shift production to the US and other parts of the world as President Reagan’s hypothesis on China's successful transition to a market economy gets invalidated
 	- World splits into two distinct economic blocs
 	- Chinese economy will face continued pressure given the following concerns

 	aging population
 	- lack of room for further domestic growth
 	- none granting of WTO market status

 	- US untangles its free market economy from the Chinese centrally controlled market economy as the latter slips into recession
