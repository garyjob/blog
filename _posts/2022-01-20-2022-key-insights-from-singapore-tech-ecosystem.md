### **Saemin Ahn - Venture Capital blockchain investment**

#### VC challenges in cryptocurrency investing

A problem faced by traditional VCs looking to invest in cryptocurrency projects

- VCs will experience problem exiting their coins when they need to pay their LPs- Developers of cryptocurrency projects might stake the liquidity provided by VCs on other currencies get the interest and then abandon their own project. EOS is a prime example- VCs are concerned about continued health of crypto project when early developers leave with out sized voting rights and tokens leaving not much motivation for newer developers

Proposed solution

- A SAAS model that charges subscription fees to cryptocurrency projects that pretty much function like Monday.com. Developers are awarded tokens only upon job completion.- SAAS model will end up with a basket of cryptocurrency tokens. This can then function as a clearing house, exchange or a fund.

Additional Insights

- Blockchain audits gain access to audit the protocol of blockchain projects prior to their listings. Utilizing this unfair advantage, they purchase stakes in stronger projects with their investment arm- Most cryptocurrencies have a offramp problem back to fiat. CHAI, LUNA and TERRA are good examples of how the offramp is managed.

### On China 

- China CCP has utilized a very blunt tool to deal with the consumer software sector- Exceptions are Hardware and Electric Vehicles industry

### Teck Chong Lim - Market Research

- Never perform research and sales lead generation at the same. It corrupts the research data and discourages the research participant from future engagement- US seeking to expand into new Asia Pacific region will need to utilize research services- Research companies maintain a database of research participants. They keep their research database fresh by periodically giving out freebies in exchange for answering questions.- COVID has reduced the use of focus groups (one off) and brought most of the research activities online. Online research panels (ongoing) is now the prevalent form- Business developers function like lone wolf hunters. Conversion rates are low usually around 1%. Their job is to find new opportunities to extend their top line. They also work on bringing back customers that have lapsed.- Account managers function like farmers. They basically retain customers and grow their customer's business.
