 	- Applying label causes two different items to be consider the same and identical - consider two wine glasses
 	- Applying a story on one of the two wine glasses causes the second one to be perceived as special - a wine glasses my good friend bought for me
 	- Ability to spin a story that is believed by more than 5 people can cause the next person to come into contact with these 5 same people to buy into the story
 	- Ability to spin a story that is believed by an entire race is unique quality of a prophet or a marketeer
