To operate from a position of neither authority nor overt power, to influence outcomes by directing the energy of the masses through deep grasping of individual needs and desires.

To claim nothing to self, to aspire to nothing, to resort to no-ado.

To exercise unlimited freedom

That which is unknown, nameless and formless cannot be grasped and thus impeded.
