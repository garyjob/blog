Three responsibilities of leadership

 	- To cause a vision and mission to have tangible result in the real world
 	- For the followers to have more growth, wealth and health with an upswing in fulfillment
 	- Self leadership - a commitment to constant self improvement

Methodology for focus: 6 key focus for each 6 weeks

Three steps to hire:

 	- character - to validate before hiring
 	- competence - hire for key strength and not for lack of weaknesses
 	- chemistry - trust your gut feeling about whether u would want to see a person day in day out

 	- focus on hi and goodbyes so that people don't feel like they are tools in your machine

problrm solving

 	- you will be amazed the kind of solutions you get when u get the right group of people in a room to discuss about it
