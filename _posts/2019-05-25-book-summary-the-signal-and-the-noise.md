### Risk versus uncertainty

 	- Risk can be mathematically modeled to yield a probability
 	- uncertainty cannot be mathematically modeled

### Conditions for quality data

Why google’s Search data is better than Facebook profile data

 	- subject feels she has privacy privacy
 	- subject feels she is not judged
 	- subject sees tangible benefit from being honest

### The hedgehog versus the fox

 	- The hedgehog approaches reality through a narrative/ideology while the fox thinks in terms of probabilities
 	- The hedgehog goes very deep in an area while the fox employs multiple different models
 	- The fox is a better forecaster than the hedgehog
 	- The fox is more tolerant of uncertainty

### Big data

 	- More data does not yield better results and predictions
 	- Deciding the right kind of data from the abundance available
 	- To do prediction it is important to start from intuition and to keep model simple
 	- qualitative data should be weighted and considered
 	- Be self aware of your own biases

### Prediction

 	- Similarity scores - clustering in Netflix and baseball
 	- Be wary of confirmation biases
 	- Be wary of overfitting using small sample size - Tokyo earthquakes and global warming
 	- Correlation does not equal causation
 	- short hand heuristics to reduce the computational space - for example chess
