Today I decided I wanted to give my blog a new look and feel. I had the fortune to meet Kelvin the other day who introduced to me this new tool called artisteer. It was impressive. I could create a new wordpress theme in minutes. Thus I did. However I still needed some programming as it does not allow the creation of widget blocks at certain unstandardized locations. But nevertheless, it did cut down on a lot of time.
