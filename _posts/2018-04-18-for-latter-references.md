**Insights**

 	- Only send emails to users that have interacted with your emails within the past 365 days
 	- Qualitative data is only as useful as your ability to extract insights out of them -

 	Use the Pareto Chart to organize themes
 	- Apply 80/20 rule

 	- Apply efforts where 20% effort that leads to 80% impact

 	Tactics that work at smaller scale might not work well at larger scale
