Productivity is the act of bringing a company closer to its goal.

The goal of any company is to make money through the fulfillment of its mission

Key parameters to monitor for meeting the goal

 	- Increase net profit
 	- Increase return on investment
 	- Increase cashflow
 	- Increase system throughput while reducing operating expense and inventory

Inventory stuck in WIP can be reduced by reducing parts that piling up in front of the bottleneck waiting for other missing parts

**Algorithm**

 	- find the most critical bottleneck in the system right now
 	- increase capacity at current most critical bottleneck until it is no longer the bottleneck
 	- repeat step one until we have built enough capacity to more than fulfill market demand
