## Magnitude - Larry Page

Any process that has served its purpose well will inevitably break when required to perform at a higher order of magnitude - Larry Page
### Examples

 	- software applications
 	- management methods

### Cross domain insight

There are no bad managers or lousy software just one that are not suitable for the task at hand

## Triage - Reid Hoffman

Figure out the most important fires you need to attend to and let the rest burn
### Application

know why what you are working on what is important for u.

Acknowledge that others are pursuing what is important for them.

Don't get distracted from what is important for u by what you see others are doing
### Cross domain insight

Envy is either a sign of an untrained mind that is proned to unnecessary psychic energy wastage or a sign that what you are working on is not that important to you
