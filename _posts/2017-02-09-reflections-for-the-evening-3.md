Learn to keep my own counsel, share information sparingly based on necessity and appropriateness

share only what has been proven and keep conjectures to self unless asked for.

Get inputs when seeing missing pieces in a mental model I am trying to understand

Only express ideas at very high levels and only if asked upon provide more details as and when required

listen to other parties ideas, feelings and identity

when the body feels tension/discomfort, the mind by nature reacts by thinking and trying to figure out ways to return to state of comfort. Learn to allow the mind to sit with the tension/discomfort instead of rejecting it
