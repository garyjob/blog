Each morning I wake up with gratitude knowing that I have been once again presented with the gift of life for another day. Each day I strive along my path. Each night I sit in regret knowing I have once again failed.

Until the day comes when I could live each and every second of my life unstained by personal egotism, all I have done along the pursuit of my path will amount to nothing. Until that day comes, each and every of my action will translate immediately into failure at the very moment of their manifestation. Until that day comes, I can only live in gratitude that I have been once again presented with the gift of life and regret that I am unworthy of that gift.

When that day comes, my works and efforts will no longer be a manifestation of personal egotism and vanity, something I have personally come to despised and look upon with regret. When that day comes, my works will be a tribute in its purest sense unstained by my failings due to the animal within. When that day comes, I will truly see myself as a man and not a abomination of nature that is half man and half animal.
