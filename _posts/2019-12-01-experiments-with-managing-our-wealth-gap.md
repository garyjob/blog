The ability to implement compounding models with competitive moats and a winner takes all dynamics in our markets inevitably leads to wealth inequality. 

Last century, we experimented with Liberalism (US), Communism (USSR), Facism (Germany) and Militarism (Japan) as solutions to tackle the problem. Liberalism was the model that won. 

Right now, in addition to continued work on Liberalism, we explore technologism, populism, socialism and terrorism. 

In worst case scenario, we should expect a system reset that is not backed by any framework when the percentage of disenfranchised crosses the critical threshold. It will be very messy when that happens.
