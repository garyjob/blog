There is a slight difference between software programming and software developement.

Software programming is just restricted to the task of writing lines of codes to create a program that fulfils a function.

Software developement entails not just programming but also the following:

	- ensuring that what was created fulfills the function it was intended for
	- that the function was defined properly
	- that all possible permutation has been tested to ensure software is robust and does not crash due to unforeseen circumstances.
	- that software be deployed and is in working order in the live environment.

No wonder software developers gets more pay than programmers.

This is most especially true for mission critical systems
