## when under attack

 	- retreat and focus of making the core value proposition stronger
 	- do not attempt to widen the surface area of the battles - causes dilution of forces
 	- improving your product from 98% to 99.99% brings more overall value to your customers

## On hiring and firing

 	- Talent density

 	high enough talent density reduces the need for dummy proofing
 	- Reduce need for dummy proofing reduces amounts of required processes
 	- Team moves faster

 	- performance plan is a waste of time both of the manager and the employee
 	- Give a generous severence package

 	give easy exit for managers
 	- give runway for ex-employees

 	- we are not a family but a team of professionals
 	- all founders fail at firing early - understanding that it is important to do so to protect the company and it is nothing selfish
 	- when dealing with people and emotions

 	use less data
 	- rely more on intuition and personal judgement

## Leadership

 	- context not control

 	Context of problem

 	constrains and limitations
 	- difficulties

 	- highly aligned loosely coupled

 	- Never let friendship get in the way of a professional judgement

 	Manage all stakeholders with compassion

 	- time spent towards self improvement as a leader will overall benefit the organization
 	- do not try to do everything yourself
 	- at different stages of an organization leading means very different things
 	- as an executive it is less about dealing with the nitty gritty details and more about unblocking your team members from getting stuff done
 	- Every CEO will inevitably make mistakes along the way

## Culture and values

 	- Culture = Context of behavior
 	- communicate it very explicitly
 	- hire base on culture and values
 	- helps ensure decisions are made the same way without you needing to be involved by being in the same room
 	- In companies with weak culture, culture is diffused and people act differently

## Timing

 	- It is hard to predict when something might happen
 	- most of the time predictions are if they are even going to happen is in itself bogus
 	- In 1995, predicted streaming would become mainstream in 2002 and then again in 2007. The trend only started emerging slightly before 2012.

## Maintaining adaptability

 	- management is by nature forced to be short term - how to improve things by X percent next quarter
 	- need to ensure against becoming a monoculture like company through over optimization with processes
 	- need to be able to respond to market changes
 	- important to keep some slack and redundancy
