The role of media is to capture and direct mass attention in exchange for currency in the form of Ads/subscription revenue. Romantization, dramatization and sensationalization of stories are often means to this ends.

The role of a builder of company is to build an engine that consistently and systematically delivers value to its customers. All pathways and exceptions identified, accounted for and systematically removed if not managed. A well ran and calibrated process should be iterative and uneventful.

Notice and see clearly the divergence between the nature of these two functions. It is important to not take the media's portrayal of what building and running a company should be at face value but rather see any such stories as coverage on what the media considers to be an exceptional event that might draw a lot of eye balls.
