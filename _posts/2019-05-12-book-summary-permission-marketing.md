In any industry, the most trusted brand is always the most profitable one

### The situation

There are too many companies spending increasing amount of dollars vying for limited attention and money of consumers

### The mistake

Companies try to minimize their marketing spend by broadcasting the same marketing materials to as wide an audience as possible.

### The right approach

Forget about the majority. Be laser focused on the audience you are targeting to build trust by starting and maintaining a dialogue with your intended audience. 

Jay Levinson: An Ad needs to be ran 27 times on the same individual to get the desired impact. 

- An Ad is seen 1 out of 9 times- An Ad needs to be seen 3 times to have the desired effect

- Be personal- Be relevant- Be Specific- Be anticipated (don't surprise them by building a regular cadence to your continued dialogue)

#### Stages of trust

- Frequency- Awareness- Familiarity- Trust- Profitability
