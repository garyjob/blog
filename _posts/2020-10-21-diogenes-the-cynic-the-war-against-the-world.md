### The building blocks of Diogenes' philosophy

 	- Self sufficiency: only need yourself and dispense with societal support
 	- Shamelessness: be willing to break even the most sacrosanct rules to express absolute freedom
 	- Indifference: be unconcerned with things not within your control
 	- Insensibility: to become insensible to both pain and pleasure
 	- Ignorance: To limit intellectual activities to those that are of immediate value for human life
 	- Disciplined training:

 	commit to a program of self training that strengthens his character,
 	- lessens dependencies on social and physical needs,
 	- maintain his desires and impulses under strict rational control

 	- Strength of character:

 	aspire to develop in himself a character and physical constitution like those associated with Hercules
 	- that renders him impervious to vicissitudes and sufferings of human life

 	- Poverty:

 	understand that virtue and happiness cannot be found in the search and acquisition of physical possessions
 	- divest himself of as many things as possible,
 	- retaining the bare necessities to keep him alive and that assure him the freedom that Hercules esteemed as the most precious thing in the world

 	- Philanthrophy

 	Recognize his moral obligation to make himself useful in the task of dispelling illusions that rob people of their ability to be happy and live in accordance with nature

 	- Contempt for the opinions of many

 	renounce the need to be honored or appreciated by others
 	- welcome repudiation and insults
 	- look with contempt or suspicion at the values and customs by which people guide themselves
