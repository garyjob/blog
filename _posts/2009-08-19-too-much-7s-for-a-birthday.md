A few days ago I came across a guy with 3 number 7s in his nric card that jumped. Just before the 7th Lunar month.

And so officially today is my birthday. I have turned 27. Ironically today while walking along the streets there were so many people on the streets making offerings of josh sticks, chicken, incense and josh paper.

Wow.. what a big occasion! Even the gates to hell opened and my brethen ghosts comes forth to celebrate the date of my birth. Mom always joked that I was so Big Hungry Ghost that happened to step wrongly into her womb got given birth into this world while foraging for food during the hungry ghost festival.

Perhaps I am. I must say I have not been really up to any good since the day I was born :P
