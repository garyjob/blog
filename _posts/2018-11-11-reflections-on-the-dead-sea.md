View of the sky when floating on the Dead Sea
### Reflection

It did not take too long for me to arrive at the dea sea after driving out of Jerusalem.

Waddling into the waters of the Dead Sea I was at first skeptical I would actually float. I was quickly proven wrong. I did float.

I experimented to figure out the most relaxed position I could adopt without drowning.

It quickly dawned on me, I was in a natural sensory deprivation tank. I was freely suspended on the water feeling zero body weight. Overhead, the clear blue sky with not a hint of cloud reminds me of the blue screen of death commonly observed when the OS crashes. My ears, submerged in water, were insulated from any noise I would otherwise hear.

This was close to the same location John the Baptist got himself baptized. I wonder how long he stayed floating in the waters of the Dead Sea when he went through the process.

I stayed suspended in this position focusing my full attention on my 5 senses. It was totally fascinating to be swept around by the ebb and flows of the Dead Sea. I conclude while the mineral concentration is abnormally high, the Dead Sea is not dead.
