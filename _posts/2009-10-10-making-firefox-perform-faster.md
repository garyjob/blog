Recently my firefox application started to slow down when I type URL of a particular web site into the locations most especially when I typed an incorred URL.

I got really annoyed with it and hence decided to find out once and for all what the hell is happening. I used to love using Firefox before until recently.

Hence I chanced upon this [site](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Changing_autocomplete_behavior_-_Firefox).

Following the instructions, I clicked on **Tools > Options > Privacy**.

I landed up on this particular page where I set **Firefox **to suggest **Nothings **when I am using the locations bar. Thereafter I applied the changes.

Immediately, I suddenly liked using FireFox again.

Next thing next to consider is how to reduce the loading time. That remains a question to be solved.
