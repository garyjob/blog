 	- Each technology exploits a natural phenomena thereby exposing a functionality to further human purpose
 	- Principal - the idea of how a phenomena is captured
 	- One technology builds on another (or a collection them) - recursion
 	- Components - components and practices
 	- functionality assumes modularity simplifies design
 	- Types of phenomena

 	Physical - what goes on in the physical environment
 	- Behavioral - what goes on in a human brain
 	- Organization - the emergent dynamics when a group of human brains interact

 	- Science is the practice of probing Nature to identify phenomena through the use of technology
 	- Engineer is a process of solving the problem to create a solution by making technology work.
 	- Invention is mental association of problem with principal and technology
 	- A technology stack when required to perform at higher levels needs to be modified to get pass bottlenecks

 	Internal replacement
 	- Structural deepening

 	can become an issue. Example

 	military organization
 	- legal system
 	- administrative system

 	- Mechanisms

 	Lock-in - preventing easy migration to new technology
 	- adaptive stretch - adopting new technology to augment existing ones

 	- Opens the door for disruption

 	- Technology buildout tends to be concentrated in one country or region - concentration of talents (people with deep craft) and the forming of a culture

 	who to talk to
 	- how to get something fixed
 	- what to ignore
 	- what theories / principals to look to

 	- An economy (how resources are exchanged) is the expression of its technology

 	Economy is neurons, flesh and blood
 	- Technology is the skeletal structure
