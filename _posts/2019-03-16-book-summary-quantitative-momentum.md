### On fund managers

 	-  fear losing their jobs
 	- are more willing to be wrong with everyone else than being potentially right alone
 	- will not be able to hold a strategy that shows consistent losses for a few quarters for a outsized win a year later
 	- Interest between fund managers and investors might not be aligned

 	wants to manage ever larger funds to increase management fee

 	- large fund sizes prevents them from entering positions where only small funds can be deployed to obtain outsized returns
