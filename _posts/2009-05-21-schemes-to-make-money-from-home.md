Recently I have been coming across site or email referring to sites that provide schemes for making money from home. Curioused at first I read through some of them but after a while I grew really tired to them. 

The real ironic part is how they could attempt to slap themselves in the face by contradicting themselves within the same page of content.

In the first part of the page they talked about how easy it was for them to make money on line some claiming to be even making up to USD$13K per week. However it you looked closely at the chunk of words just above the personal details submission form you will see this

****INCOME DISCLAIMER:**** Even though CarbonCopyPRO has notarized affidavits on hand for every one of the income claims on this site, these income examples are representative of some of the most successful participants in the program. Some members may make little or NO MONEY AT ALL with this program. These claims are not a guarantee of your income, nor are they typical of average participants. Individual results will vary greatly and in accordance to your input, determination, hard work, and ability to follow directions. By using this website you are agreeing to our *[*Legal Income Disclaimer*](http://onlinebusinessonautopilot.com/zearnings.htm)

If you are observation enough you will notice this specific sentence

*these income examples are representative of some of the most successful participants in the program. Some members may make little or NO MONEY AT ALL with this program. *

So basically they are trying to convince you to spend time working on their program but saying "Hey you are on your own buddy." What kind of contradictory crap is this?
