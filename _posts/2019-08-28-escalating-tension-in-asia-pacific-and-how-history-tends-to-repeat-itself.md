US is a divided country holding two conflicting points of view which are both very valid given existing set of evidences. This is the inherent drawback of democratic systems when faced with foreign threats. The dysfunction of the Roman military during periods of the Punic Wars is a fine example.

It is noteworthy to observe how populism and militarism tends to rise in times of extended economic hardships and during periods immediately prior to major outbreak of wars. Trump is the modern day equivalent of Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill who were both considered populists during their times.
