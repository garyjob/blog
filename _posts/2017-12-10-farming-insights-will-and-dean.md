Will on soil management

 	- till and water land
 	- wait for one week
 	- pull out grass and plant seeds
 	- gives seeds a head start

Dean: worm and composting

 	- keep three containers on top of a single one at the bottom
 	- put worms in it.
 	- Worms will migrate upwards to where the food is
 	- lower containers will only be left with soil
 	- by worms from amazon
 	- Home Depot sells fake soil to aid water drainage
 	- can setup hydroponics with fish as s system
 	- buy a pump to pump water onto soil where plants are growing
 	- shit from fish goes to becoming fertilizer
