### On Extract Transform and Load operations (ETL) 
Always preserve the ability to audit how data is transform from prior one value to another. It might become necessary to derive over data variants off the original value

### Local Proximity Optimization versus Global Proximity Optimization
Each is a hill climbing algorithm within its own scope. Global proximity optimization attempts to hill climb at a scope that is a super set of of the local proximity. At times it is important for the local proximity hill climbing algorithm to become sub-optimize so the global proximity hill climbing algorithm could reach its highest peak

In a terrain there are multiple Potentials Peaks, the draw back of a hill climbing algorithm is that once a hill top is established, it is extremely hard to coordinate  the resources between current hill top exploitation and new hill tops discovery.

Current hill top exploitation is a pull towards operational efficiency. New hill tops discovery is a pull towards maintain slack and thus adaptability within the system.
