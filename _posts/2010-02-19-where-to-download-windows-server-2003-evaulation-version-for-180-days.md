I tried searching for the longest time on microsoft.com site. It was painful. It seems the site has grown so big and complex and absolutely hard to navigate.

Thankfully Google came to the rescue. I found this URL which you could download the [180 days windows server 2003 Trial Version](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/r2/trial/installinstruct.mspx?lc=1033) from.

Good Luck
