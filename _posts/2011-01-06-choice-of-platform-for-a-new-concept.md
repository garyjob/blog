After some delays, I finally started work programmically on this new concept I have in mind. The first step was to choose how to start.

I have 3 choices in front of me:

	- Start by creating a platform from scratch as I did for ThingsToDoSingapore.com
	- Start by using the Joomla Content Management System as I did for Name1price.com
	- Start by using the wordpress Content Management System as I did for WinterInVenice and PixieMagicalland.

The following are the basis on which I made my decision:

	- Conformity of look and feel across pages
	- Fast loading
	- Ease of programmability
	- Flexible deployment of plugins
	- Ability to leverage on existing codes

The main reason as to why I choose Wordpress over building one from scratch is because it allowed me to ensure conformity of look and feel across pages. It does however take away somewhat from the ease of programmability department, since I will need to program in the functionality via the hookup system that is the inherent core of wordpress

The framework of Joomla is somewhat more rigid as compared to wordpress. It scores even lower in the ease of programmability department. It scores the same in the conformity of look and feel department. The main downside of Joomla as compared to wordpress is that each page is limited to just one main component and multiple modules. As this concept of mine is still in its infant stage, I will require flexibility in that department as well. A hookup system will thus fit my requirements nicely.

All said I will now start working on the initial landing page which allows for registration of 3 different types of accounts.
