Saudi Arabia held oil price at artificial low levels

 	- curbing Russian involvement in Syria
 	- Collateral damage:

 	small shale Oil companies

 	required USD$80/ barrel to breakeven operations
 	- [35 shale oil companies](https://marcellusdrilling.com/2015/11/list-of-36-oil-gas-companies-that-filed-for-bankruptcy-in-2015/) filed for chapter 11
 	- caught in precarious position of being over-leveraged and unprofitable for extensive periods of time

 	- Large oil companyBP

 	trading at close to Net Book Value for more than a year (2016-2017)
 	- price still recovering after 2 years (2018)

 	- Countries can hold an industry suppressed longer than impacted companies can stay liquid
 	- large cap companies will trade for extensive periods at close to net book value. Might be a good buy when markets turn around
 	- If industry is directly affected, cut losses and bail
