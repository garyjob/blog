The choice is to invest in overcoming obstacles presented by reality (a.k.a. exercise freedom of choice)

**Mindset**

 	- Acknowledge you might not know the inner workings of most things
 	- Be confident that you are capable of figuring out how things work
 	- Bad luck = reality meets lack of preparation. Approach reality like a scientist provides the needed preparation

**Heuristics**

 	- Reality is inherently simple. Complicated patterns made up of simple patterns combined together.

 	The more complicated the situation seems to be the simpler the solution must be - fractals
 	- Dive deeply into the heart of the issue and seek simpler solutions over complicated ones (with less components).
 	- Be wary of admiration of sophistication
 	- When solving complex tangled problems, tackle the most important one head on (root cause) and the rest will take care of themselves (symptoms).

 	- On conflicts

 	When there is conflict determine if the underlying root cause of a conflict is due to faulty assumption or an actual contradiction.
 	- If reality is inherently simple, then naturally occurring contradictions are unlikely.
 	- blaming someone else shifts precious attention away from removing the obstacle
 	- harmony is the natural state of things in reality when wrongful assumptions have been removed

 	- Never stop improving on a existing situation however good it is

 	List all key assumptions and challenge everyone of them
 	- develop stamina to overcome failures ( opportunities to further calibrate my neural network)
 	- develop stamina to think clearly consistently

Insights

 	- Intuition stems from emotions. Things we have repeatedly trained our own personal neural network with.
