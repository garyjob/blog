We observe the following impact to be true for ETFs

 	- democratizing access for individuals to positions traditionally accessible only to  hedge fund managers

 	- increasing population of investors with passively managed portfolios
 	- giving tech savvy individuals with finance background an edge by reducing active professional competition
