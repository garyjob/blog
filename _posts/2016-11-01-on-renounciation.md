A more profound form of realization was had this evening while driving. If at every moment in life, one is prepared to renunciate/give up anything and everything that one holds dearly to heart at that very moment and perhaps even life itself, then there is nothing in that life could be taken away from oneself that might lead to any form of aversion and thus any form of physical/mental suffering.

With that as a premise, one can at any time renounce striving of any form or manner.  One can thus witness, experience and let go of any form of pain. This is in itself ultimate liberation.
