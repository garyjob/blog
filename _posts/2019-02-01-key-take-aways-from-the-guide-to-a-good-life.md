### Overview

The core of Stoicism as a philosophy is to live a good life (where peace of mind is deemed the highest good) by learning how to manage negative thoughts like:

 	- anger
 	- anxiety
 	- fear
 	- grief
 	- envy

### Techniques

This is done through the employment of these two techniques
#### Negative visualization techniques

 	- Managing against hedonic adaptation by learning to desire what we already have. To do so, we must constantly remind ourselves the transient nature of things.

#### Focus of attention on what is within our loci of control

 	- Totally within our control - focus our attention of these things
 	- Partially within our control - internalize goals around parts where we have control
 	- Totally out of our control - learn to be at peace with whatever outcome

#### Deliberate self denial

By deliberately depriving self the luxuries, one builds courage and self-control
#### Manage needs and desires

 	- natural and necessary

 	Food and shelter
 	- to fulfill

 	- natural and unnecessary

 	Fine wine and luxurious food
 	- to fulfill if not too much hassle

 	- unnatural and unnecessary

 	fame and social status
 	- to shun

 	- unnatural and necessary

 	nothing exist in this category

### Attitude towards time

 	- The past and the immediate present is beyond change - be grateful for all that has came to pass and accept it with equanimity
 	- The immediate future is where our loci of control falls - this is where we should channel our attention

### Eras of stoiscism
