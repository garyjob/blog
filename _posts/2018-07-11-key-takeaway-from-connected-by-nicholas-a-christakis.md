 	- Our ties to others affect emotions, sex, health, politics, money, evolution and technology
 	- Acts of aggression typical set off a cascade of killings

 	morality resides in groups instead of individuals

###  Insights

 	- the particular pattern of ties are more important than the individuals
 	- different patterns facilitate the individuals in the groups
 	- structures are more important than shared traits of individuals
 	- we influence how densely connected we are
 	- core discussions network decreases as we age
 	- needs tending and should not be taken for granted
 	- our mirror neurons gets affected by our network

### Principles

 	- emergent properties

 	inherent in the interactions and interconnection of the parts

 	- Rule 5 - social proofing from 5 people is as effective as any number above that
 	- 6 degree of connectedness
 	- 3 degrees of influence

 	network instability inhibits 4th degrees

 	- Situational inequality

 	where you are in the network matters
 	- affects if you are healthier or richer than others
 	- even if you have no control

### On Mating

 	- your network will find a mate for you

 	being in a network with more men than women makes it harder to find a partner and leads to a shorter life

 	- Much easier to go for a guy that other women in your network are going for

 	assessment is already done by others

 	- Men bring money and resources to the table
 	- Women bring emotional/social support
 	- friendship network and mating network are very different

### On Friendship

 	- Habits / behavior spread - culture

 	obesity
 	- suicide

 	- can be attributed to mirror neurons
 	- behavior of female is more contagious than the behavior of male
 	- people who have five friends who know one another has a different genetic makeup than a person with five friends who do not know one another

 	religion is the opiate of disconnected people

### On Health

 	- Targeting folks at the central of a network to treat an epidemic is more effective than treating those at the fringes in the case of aids

### On Politics

 	- Being in a politically active network makes you more likely to vote even in they support the opposing politician
 	- peer pressure
 	- voting makes no logical sense, since your impact is statistically insignificant

### Mathematics

 	- Contagion goes through a pattern called Levy Flight

 	imagine a seagull
 	- Mathematicians

 	Pierre Levy
 	- Benoit Mandelbrot

 	- Weighted average of the crowd is not that inaccurate

### Weak ties versus Strong ties

 	- Strong ties help dissemination within networks
 	- Weak ties act as bridge between different networks

 	useful for search large areas of networks
 	- people with lots of weak ties get more frequently sought out for advice and given opportunities
 	- they become central to the overall network
 	- minority power effect - a small group of influentially positioned individuals can consistently get their way

 	- it appears we often start our search for information two or three degrees away to make sure we learn something new

### On language

 	- makes it easier to interact with people as types rather than as individuals

### Online networks

 	- roles

 	Co-operators
 	- free riders
 	- punishers

 	manages public good versus private good
