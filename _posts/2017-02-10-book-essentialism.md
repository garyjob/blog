- constantly discard what is not in line with your goals
 	- Focus attention and energy on the intention and the outcome will take care of itself
 	- Social awkwardness:

 	effectiveness and popularity does not go hand in hand
 	- its better to say NO up front and feel slightly awkward during the process then to say Yes up front and feel resentful later

 	- Make your own priorities and decisions:

 	Otherwise someone else will make it for u
 	- protect your sleep

 	- Unless feeling absolutely passionate about an undertaking say no by default
 	- Batttling sunk cost bias:

 	how much would I pay for this if I didn't own it?
 	- would I buy this if I did not already own it?

 	- bringing nothing extra to the table

 	Treat them how they need to be treated not how u think they need to be treated
 	- wasting attention watching the clock when needing to do something as fast as possible does not help the task
