What has first weakened will eventually strengthen while what has first strengthen must eventually weakened, such is the nature of things.

To perceive others is thus to hold a mistaken view of suchness. To abide with strength during the weakening of situations is pride and unwarranted egoism, to abide with weakness during the strengthening of situations is a lack of faith.

Strengthen and weaken thus, not attributing this phenomena to the self. For to do either is to seek but trouble unto self.
