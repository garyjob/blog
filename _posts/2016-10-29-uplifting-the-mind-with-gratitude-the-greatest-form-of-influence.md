Gratitude leads to awareness: One thing became immediately noticeable when interacting with others while harboring the spirit of gratitude. The mind starts becoming more cognizant of the inherent goodness of the other and how he/she is actively seeking to contribute.

Awareness leads to choice of words: Words that come forth thus are filled with acknowledgment and appreciation. Personal egocentric and egotistic needs/striving falls away while the mind fully immerses in the world of the other.

Immersion leads to receptiveness: walking in the shoe of the other, one can see clearly the possible recommendations that will be receptive by the other to solve whatever problems at hand. This leads to more opportunities for one to express gratitude.

This virtuos cycle continues thus.
