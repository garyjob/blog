## Mission versus Vision

 	- Mission - an ultimate goal that is measurable and can be executed upon
 	- Vision - the dream / an aspiration
 	- Strategy - what we need to do
 	- Priorities - in what order do we need to do

## Empathy versus Compassion

 	- Empathy: being able to feel the suffering of the person in front of you
 	- Compassion: A more objective form of empathy. Feeling the suffering of the person in front of you and executing upon a plan to alleviate the person's suffering

## Culture

 	- becomes exceedingly important when building a large scale organization as it helps aligns the actions and decision making process of individuals functioning within the organization
 	- A commonly accepted way of doing things
 	- important to find the people that live and breathe the culture when hiring
 	- Increases the speed of making high quality decision

## Optimization concerns

 	- Local proximity versus global proximity optimization

 	an unsolvable problem
 	- clairty of mission and vision is important in managing this problem

## At different scales

 	- Preserving optionality - needed to be a good investor
 	- Scaling up - need to define what the core of the company is
 	- As the company goes through the scaling process and becomes a big behemoth a lot of the entrepreneurial DNA will become diluted as roles becomes more specialized. It becomes important to figure out how to continue cultivating this DNA so that the company still has the muscle to catch the next wave of innovation
