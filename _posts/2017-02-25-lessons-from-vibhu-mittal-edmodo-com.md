You are more what you read than what you write.
What you write or say is more representative of what you think other people want to read or hear.

What you do and write is more often based out of necessity than out of joy and interest. What you choose to spend your time on is more often based out of interest and curiosity.

An example would be an engineer who hates computer science but does it out of necessity to pay bills, while at the concurrently investing a lot of time on his interest in music.

A manager hiring this engineer would gain more value from him if hiring him for both his skill sets as an engineer in the domain of music than if just purely hiring him for his abilities in programming.

Word2Vec is a statistics based classification library that's been open sourced. Given Edmodo's data set, we should be able to determine each person's interest based on his past activities over the duration of his time in Edmodo and thereafter recommend to him other people who have invested much time in this space - This facilitates the statement "who you eventually become who you hang out with"

Once we get the distraction of fund raising and achieving break even out of the way, we should devote ourselves fully to building out the most comprehensive recommendation engine for the activity of learning
