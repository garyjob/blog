### Agenda #1: Marketing to finance people on the research side of things versus prospecting side of things

 	- the channels
 	- the kinds of budget they have
 	- their buying behavior

### Agenda #2. Building up a data-set

 	- the features you would use in trading
 	- the kinds of systems they use
 	- how to package it to make it easy to import to their systems
