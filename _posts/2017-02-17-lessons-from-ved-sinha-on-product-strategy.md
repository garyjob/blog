Types of Tech companies

 	- Software - network companies
 	- Software - efficiency companies
 	- Hardware

Drivers that create a fast moving environment which makes possible fast Pace of innovation

 	- Network capacity
 	- Moores law - hardware capability
 	- more product n services gets created that were previously not possible
 	- This is on top of Demographic changes - traditional companies will generally deal with this

Five year plans needs to take into account the chip/network innovation trajectory

A typical cycle of planning

 	- 3 year visions
 	- plan for next 4 quarters
 	- ship on a weekly basis
 	- vision could always change

Time horizons for execution iterations
