Recently with a few of my sites becoming quite popular, I started considering the possibility of migrating some of them over to Singapore hosting services so as to reducing their loading time. I did a quick search on google and took a look at all the hosting services available on the first page.Out of all these I short listed the following.

	- webhosting.com.sg
	- vodien.com
	- usonyx.net
	- hostsg.com

In terms of price competitiveness webhosting.com.sg is the most expensive of the lot. Offering just a mere 500mb while charging more than the rest. I cancelled that out.

I next went into command prompt and did a tracert on all 4 hosting providers. **Webhosting.com.sg **and **hostsg.com** both required 15 hops from where I am before I arrived at their servers

That left vodien.com and usonyx.net. Both of them just required 13 hops from where I am.

Now I started to price comparison.

One particular pacckage by Vodien.com is going for SGD$8 has the following configuration

	- 5 gb space
	- 999 mysql database
	- php 5 support
	- unlimited domain add ons
	- cpanel

Another corresponding package by usonyx.net is going for SGD$8 has the following configuration

	- 5gb space
	- 2 mysql database
	- php 5 support
	- 1 domain add ons
	- plesk

Also it seems the portfolio of Vodien.com is quite strong with all the major education institutions on board.It seems Vodien.com is the clear choice to go for.
