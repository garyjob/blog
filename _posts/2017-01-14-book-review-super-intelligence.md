Types of AI

 	- weak AI - machine with ability to achieve well defined objective. Expert systems

 	- strong AI - machine with ability to self define objectives, acquire and deploy resources to achieve them. General intelligence system

Types of super intelligence

 	- speed intelligence: an intellect just like human but faster

 	- Collective superintelligence: A system composed of a large number of smaller intellects such that the system’s overall performance across many very general domains vastly outstrips that of any current cognitive system.

 	- Quality super intelligence: ability to independently determine and optimize for parameters that bring about desired quality

 	- direct and indirect reach: ability to acquire all three intelligence given foundational access to one

Methods to achieving super intelligence

key areas of concern:

 	- higher order Thinking to define guiding principles to ensure AI does not compromise human values
 	- human values in itself is hard to define and nail down
