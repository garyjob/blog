 	- The same set of raw facts can be used to construct a really positive story or a really negative one. Choose your frame wisely.
 	- Ethics is not universal, but restricted for application only on a group. In domains where ethics don’t exist, Might means right applies.
 	- Do not count on continued gratitude and love from the crowd. They will just as soon turn against you as they would worship you
 	- When dealing within conflict first elicit all existing context, thereafter make your case by applying clear logic and consistent argument.
 	- Be wary of individuals with dubious characters. If anything, you can always trust them to stay dubious.
 	- Market is not always readily available. There needs to be willing buyers and willing sellers
 	- The vision will stay the same while the nitty gritty details should remain flexible to cater to changes as required.
 	- Timing is important. Some times are not conducive for specific activities while others are. The use of sacrifice /blood magic should be helpful in decipheringbthe present moment given a clear binary frame.
