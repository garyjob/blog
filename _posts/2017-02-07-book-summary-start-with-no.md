 	- focus on goal - action and behavior u have control over. E.g dont act needy in negotiations
 	- do not focus on objective - results/outcome U have no control over. E.g. Closing the deal

 	- define mission and purpose: it should be based on adversary's world view

 	- dont say no for adversary. Let him take responsibility for his decisions

 	- don't think win win - aka forget about the need to give up ground
 	- always phrase questions to elicit any objections he might have - this will help get pass emotional issues to essential issues that need addressing

 	- Ask interrogative lead questions to unpack the subject

 	who ...
 	- what ...
 	- when ...
 	- where ...
 	- why ...
 	- how ...
 	- how much ...

 	- Avoid verb lead questions to avoid skewing the subject's response

 	can we do ...
 	- is it ...

 	- A leaders job is to paint a clear VISION of the PAIN as well as the SOLUTION to remove the PAIN
 	- No PAIN = no DECISION
 	- Avoid triggering off too much negative or positive emotions

 	- budget - always set the budget U want to allocate for a specific negotiation

 	Time n Effort = 1X
 	- Money = 2X
 	- Emotions = 4X

 	- keep a close watch on the budget and make sure the opponent does not drive it above budget
 	- never compromise on ur mission and purpose just because u think u have already blow your budget
 	- figure out the pain and corresponding budget of the adversary

 	- decision maker: figure out who is that person and what is his pain and what is driving his cost
 	- Blocker: figure out who are the blockers and use interrogative questions to get around them
 	- Blocker: important to have him feel ok
