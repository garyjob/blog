### The steps prior to consuming

 	- See mushroom
 	- Collect entire mushroom

 	cap
 	- stipe
 	- sections of the substrate / what it grows on

 	- note terrain its growing at
 	- make spore print overnight
 	- consult guidebook
 	- search for competing lookalikes that might be poisonous
 	- decide to eat it
 	- post eating - check for symptom of poisoning

 	first symptoms can occur as early as 20mins into consumption
 	- **if first symptom occurs only after 6 hours of consumption visit emergency room - you might have consumed an Amanitin containing variant and are about to  DIE!!**

 	Galerina marginata
 	- Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap
 	- Amanita ocreata, the Destroying Angel

These ones will kill you for sure
