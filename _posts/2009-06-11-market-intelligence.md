There are many ways to do market research but some of the best ways to know what companies outside are doing is to either ask them for a quote of a potential product or attempt to get hired.

Big companies are in the process of jumping on to the band wagon. While the smaller ones are already there occupying the various niches.

social Media apparently is here to stay
