### Federal Reserve’s two pronged mission

 	- Maximum employment
 	- Price stability at 2% inflation

### Indicators utilized to proxy inflation

 	- Unemployment levels
 	- wage levels
 	- consumption levels
 	- Agriculture
 	- manufacturing
 	- Business investments
 	- trade levels

### Departments overview

US treasury and Federal Reserve are non-political entities

 	- Government
 	- US treasury - controls exchange rates
 	- Federal reserve focus on domestic concerns only

### Observations

 	- will not act on sentiment driven from cross currents like Trade war and China’s deleveraging
 	- will wait to see more of how trends pan out before acting
 	- most countries find it challenging to sustain a 2% inflation rate
 	- wage level increases has remained subdued despite increase demand for labor
 	- balance sheets of banks are well stress tested
 	- balance sheets of non-banks like mutual funds are not well tested
