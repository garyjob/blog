### Key advice for Startups and emerging companies

 	- Start small
 	- Stay lean
 	- Raise only the funding you really need and grow judiciously.
 	- Alignment from all parties on exit strategy is extremely important
 	- Best time to sell a company is when the future has never looked brighter

### On VCs

 	- Interest of VCs might not be aligned with interest of founders and angel investors
 	- VCs need to satisfy the needs of their LPs

 	Need their successful companies to generate a minimum of 10-30X return for their fund to perform respectably, taking into account overall failure rates
 	- They thus need to wait longer to exit and work their investments harder.
 	- They are ok to accelerate the growth of their investments with their capital or blow it up quick for a capital right off. The latter helps minimize management overheads.
 	- They will block a sale if the return multiples do not meet their expectation

 	- VC return multiples of term sheet valuation

 	Series A - 10X return
 	- Series B - 4-7X returns
 	- SEries C - 2-4X returns

 	- VC funds have been getting bigger overtime. The need to deploy their capital forces them to seek for opportunities where likelihoods are slim.
 	- Companies with VC money tend to exit at year 16 on the average

### On Angels

 	- Invest much less money than VCs

 	USD10,000 to USD250,000

 	- Happy to exit in a few years with a 3-5X return
 	- In the 50s and 60s
 	- prior successful entrepreneurs or senior executives
 	- allocate around 5-10% for angel investing
 	- has experience and inclination to be great mentors and valuable directors
 	- Companies with angel only money tend to exit at year 4 on the average

 	- huge amounts of cash on balance sheets of large corporation
 	- growth in Private equity and buy out funds

### Insights on Growth

 	It is easy for young companies to maintain year on year compound annual growth rates of 100% or even 200%

 	- Knowledge of how hard it is to be a CEO and lots of money in the bank is usually a huge deterrent for serial entrepreneurship.
 	- VCs replace CEOs of 75% of companies within 18 months of their initial investments

 	- Use a 2 year time horizon

 	year 1 develop technology
 	- year 2 develop distribution

### On valuation

 	- A lot of factors that have the biggest impact on a company's short term value fluctuation will be out of management's control
 	- The factors will also be unforeseen
 	- General valuation multiples

 	SAAS companies are typically valued at 3-4 RR
 	- Service body shops 0.5 of per staff revenue or PE ratio of 3-4

### On sales process

 	- Typically 4-5 months
 	- CEOs must focus on the business to ensure metrics are at their best during the sales to maximize valuation

 	can add up to 10-20% more valuation

 	- Until the very last phase of the sales, it is best to delegate the sales process to a professional

 	Business broker or M&A advisor - use them as the bad guy

 	2-3% of final value

 	- boutique firms shoot for USD20-70 million
