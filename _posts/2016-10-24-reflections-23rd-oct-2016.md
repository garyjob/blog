Learnings from sailing today:

	- Have faith in team mates and trust they will make good decisions
	- this free up attention to focus on what your own task

learnings from book:

	- Appearing human allows people around to feel good
	- Do not help your negotiating party make decision or make them feel good by "compromising". Give them the true details so that they are given the opportunity to take "responsibility" for their own decision
	- present what you can offer clearly and also state if they cannot accept the offer, no hard feelings, they should not feel obliged to do so
