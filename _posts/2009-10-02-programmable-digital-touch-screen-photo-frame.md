I am currently helping Satheesh source for digital photoframes which allows for touchscreen as well as open API programming. Apparently after exhausting all the search results over Google, I realize there are actually none in the market. Ouch!

It seems while smaller gadgets like Iphone and the Android phone offer these functions, most currently existing gadgets don't. I suddenly got me thinking, what is the possibility of assembling one such hardware, the corresponding operating system and the specific software that allows this functionality.

Perhaps Google or Microsoft might discover this as an interesting untapped market and build a light operating system for this. Then again perhaps not, in the case of Google.

I think the installation of a Linux box on such a system might work. Then again it leaves me thinking of the hardware aspects of it. Well that really is foreign territory then.
