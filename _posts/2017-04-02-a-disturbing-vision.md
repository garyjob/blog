Had this vision the other day after my meditation session. Decided to put it down in drawing while I was at the Russian Ride Open Reserve

In this picture is a man caught with a giant hook through his cheek.

The name of the hook is called Identity. The line which this hook is attached to is called Meaning. The line is looped around this pole at the top and the name of the pole is called Ignorance.

The thing holding on to the other end of the line that is generating so much tension and thus suffering is no other than the hand of this man.

Through ignorance, we seek to find meaning in our existence and through meaning we build our identity.

It is this constant clinging on these abstract concepts while attempting to live in everyday reality that causes so much unnecessary pain.
