Design thinking is a more elaborate waterfall like model as compared to User centric design

 	- It was originally created by the dude from SAP which is the founder of IDEO

### User Centric Design

Helps avoid thinking of solution purely in [functional terms](http://garyteh.com/2018/08/reflections-for-the-morning-7/) devoid of human values
#### Goals

 	- Business Goals - numbers you want to hit as a business

#### Assumptions

 	- List of hypothesis revolving around your business goals

#### User(s)

 	- Who

 	the various personas about your user
 	- it is centered around the kinds of physical behavior they exhibit
 	- it is centered around the emotions and attitude
 	- In a market place or social network the following distribution would hold true

 	1% content creators - the protagonist
 	- 9% synthesizers - they transmute the inputs from the creators
 	- 90% silent majority - they observe and consume what was generated

 	- Problems / Needs

 	centered around the day to day needs they have in their role
 	- centered around the day to day problems they experience because of the need they have
 	- qualitative and quantitative data to size of each segment of persona as well as the conversion rates in prior experiments

 	- Themes

 	The commonly recurring themes identified based on qualitative feedbacks gathered from interviews with users.
