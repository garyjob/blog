when involved in any form of commercial transaction beware that you are not exchanging any currencies for a commodity known as "being liked".

The commodity translates to a sensation that is triggered off by the release of dopamine in the brain.

It is important to perform with effectiveness during commercial transactions. treating the other with respect is more than sufficient

attempting to load transaction with emotional baggage is like masturbating during work.
