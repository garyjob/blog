### Primary mandate

 	- Stable prices at 2% inflation rate
 	- Low unemployment rate

### Highlights of the US economy

 	- US unemployment is at 3.7% the lowest in 50 years
 	- Longest period of economic expansion at 11 years
 	- Philips curve is dead - Inflation rate and unemployment rate seems to be  decoupled and no longer correlated

### Key concerns within the environment

 	- US inflation rate has fell below 2%
 	- slowing global growth

 	manufacturing
 	- investments
 	- trade
 	- business fixed investments

 	- international trade volume slow down
 	- slowing US business investments
 	- lots of central bank with low interest rates have little wiggle room if recession were to occur

### Federal Reserve as an institution

 	- US economy is 70% consumer driven
 	- Responds to congress policies
 	- Responds to fiscal policies
 	- reopens market when economy grinds to a halt
 	- resilient to president's (executive branch) meddling
 	- utilizes framework and the tools available to achieve symmetrical 2% inflation rate
 	- Fiscal policy is more powerful than monetary policy

 	becomes critical during a severe downturn

 	- 4 key pillars of monitor

 	Asset price
 	- leverage in financial system
 	- leverage away from banks
 	- funding risks

 	- Fed will negotiate with other countries and will reject terms if international terms cannot be expected to work within the US system - Insurance Capital Standards
 	- Will look for more tools to pursue mandate since interest rate is already very low
 	- Can handle counter cyclical policies

 	buying US treasuries to increase supply of money in circulation

### On the labor market

 	- Income inequality

 	1% owns 40% of wealth in America

 	- US has less social mobility than other more developed countries

 	since 40 years ago US education system has not be able to train people to capitalize on technology and globalization

 	- Median and lower income has stagnated (those without a degree)

 	Only increased 3% wage increase despite low unemployment rates
 	- does not make up 2% inflation rate and productivity gains
 	- chief causes

 	technology: automation has severely increased individual productivity and thus throughput capacity while production demand has not yet caught up with this increased capacity
 	- globalization: more and more qualified workforce is coming online around the world that can be employed

 	- community in the fringes finally getting to join the workforce in recent years after 2008 recession
 	- employers having problems finding qualified people to fill positions - 7 million open positions within the US

 	good people skills

 	service economy
 	- manufacturing economy

 	- opioid crisis

### Uneven development

 	- US 3.7% unemployment rates

### On minimum wage

 	- concerns over job loss when USD15 minimum wage is imposed
 	- some will lose their jobs
 	- others will make more money

### Quantitative easing

 	- expected to happen again this year
 	- has caused substantial buildup of federal reserves
 	- 22 trillionUSD Federal debt in total
 	- corporate tax rate cuts leads to another expected 1trillion USD deficit this year
 	- interest on government debt expected to become largest category of federal government expense by 2026 - government has less money to spend on anything else expect paying debts
 	- Higher debt should have lead to higher interest rates, due to the special case of US being a reserve currency, government has been able to continue borrowing at low interest rates

 	Japan has higher debt to GDP ratio and low interest rates

 	- Debt will get past on to next generation
 	- If does not occur will undermine USD as the world's reserve currency

### World's reserve currency

 	- A very stable equilibrium for a long time
 	- Can potentially have multiple currencies
 	- On going back to the gold standard

 	will undermine the Dual mandate
 	- Federal reserve will be forced to managed the price of gold instead - which sometimes fluctuate wildly

 	- Currently USD was the British Pound a while back

 	- rule of law
 	- open to commerce with international trading nations

 	- fiscal sustainability

### Banking sector concerns

 	- Going off LIBOR rate at end of 2021

 	Banks will no longer be required to offer a LIBOR rate at the end of day
 	- will present a coordination problem especially for assets that do not have a predefined rate - mortgages

 	- potential reduction of banks stress buffer
 	- banks prefer to hold reserves versus treasury
 	- bank CEOs areas of worries

 	leveraged lending
 	- shadow banking

 	CLO/Hedge funds/ Mutual funds - area Global Financial Stability board is actively looking into

 	- works closely with the Federal reserves

### Speed up payment systems

 	- use case: allowing cheques to clear faster so that mum can cash in salary to pay for food at home
 	-  participants

 	regional banks
 	- big banks
 	- technologists

 	- Federal Reserve will enter the market directly to be the settler
