After yesterday evening's session with David and Gabriel, I adopted David and Gabriel's methodology and started crafting up my own business plan too. Thus far I am already 9 pages into the document. This document when finally completed will cover all aspects of my business operations down to the finest details. Major components of this document will include company mission, marketing, sales, operations, finance, human resourcing, accounting and directions for future expansion.

I have managed to uncover quite a few forms of which format I will need to draft and redraft clearly. This will ease the delegation of specific processes within this business model out to the eventual employees that will be engaged to fulfil the various task as well as communications between employees. Also I have managed to identify specific areas of hiccups that will happen within the various processes within this business model and have already crafted counter measures to alleviate these problems.

As I progress further along in the developement of this business plan, I will be able to gain clarity on all aspects of the business. If done correctly and properly, the final picture that will be painted in the financial section will give me a clear picture of the financing requiring for the daily operation of this business model, the feasible rate of growth possible and last but not the least the ROI. The document should also provide me with a clear picture of the configurations I will need in each project team (which I will term a cell) as well as the fixed cost in sustaining a cell.

Already in the first 9 pages of my documents, I could clearly identify specific portions of my business process that could be consolidated into a clear concrete role for an employee to be delegated to a human resource located off shore.

The way I see it, the more I am able to document in details the processes that will occur within my business model, the more predictability and less ambiguity there will be. This is translate into less difficulty when it comes to the task of work delegation by me to my future employees.
