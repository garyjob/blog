**Danger flags**

 	- before a person does something bad, there's often predictable signs that they were going to do it

 	Choose your companions wisely
 	- someone who is usually experienced periodically screws up a task
 	- do not employ people for areas where they are already flagged

 	but very expensive to constantly maintain this cognitive overhead

 	- avoid hiring people who get very self-destructive when anxious
 	- test them with small mission

 	- Machiavelli: The Prince

 	its much safer to be respected than loved

 	preferable to be both if possible
 	- people promise you the sky (love you) when you are in power and treating them nicely and doing them favors - promises which won't be fulfilled when crisis hits or war breaks out
 	- if someone truly respects you, some sort of liking and shared understanding tends also to emerge

 	- It is better to cultivate one very sharp skill than be mediocre at everything with no danger flags
 	- Grim determination is a good trait to cultivate - follow through to the bitter end
 	- *Ray Dalio: Principles* - how to live up to your potential

 	objectively diagnose one's mistake
 	- cultivate friends who will point out your blind spots
 	- avoid ego and shortsightedness to uncover mistakes and weaknesses

 	- Major danger flags - avoid when identified

 	inability to face pain
 	- regular justification
 	- believing self to be an exception
 	- only taking internal view and not taking external view

 	in any new endeavor find the base rates of success and failure

 	- Identify and mitigate against structural problems

 	first step is to identify them
 	- single points of failure

 	- Paul Graham, Keep your identity small

 	the more labels you have for yourself the dumber they make you
 	- bravado

 	- Money usage: people who never had enough money are prone to bribery
 	- Neglect: lack of vigilance
 	- Inflammability: ease of in-sighting anger

**Limit breaks**

 	- Allocation and Time as a measure of priority

 	know where you are spending your time
 	- reduce time on insignificant things

 	quit lesser pleasures
 	- arrange your evening so that it is not cut in the middle by a meal
 	- take the time you have available seriously
 	- number of decisions per day
 	- actions per minute

 	- largest overlooked gains in a field:

 	Study into seemingly unrelated fields or those lagging prestige

 	- Perfect practice leads to perfect performance
 	- Automate where possible

 	remove recurring not important work
 	- spend time to sit, think and study your own work
 	- strive on being better, not perfect

 	- Decide what not to do and never do it
 	- Unfinished work decays overtime
 	- People who are able to answer controversial questions well would do well on other types of questions more often than chance

 	ability to reasons through and coming to a conclusion

 	- Search for basic procedure

 	identify hidden logic

 	- Codification, doctrine and training
 	- Strength on weakness/opportunity
 	- Understand the cost of doing things

 	reduce scope
 	- understand 80/20 - 80% of the effort to get the final 20% completed

 	- Negotiations: define win conditions
 	- Investing - always focus on earnings
 	- Be right than get distracted in appearing good

**Lingua Franca**

 	- Words in a language limits the ability to express specific ideas
 	- Control perception to control how the masses operate
 	- any idea brought to its extreme becomes its exact opposite - calibration is important
 	- Rhetoric - persuasive language
 	- Ethics versus morality

 	external code of conduct versus internal belief system/world view
 	- guilt versus shame

 	- Ethos, Pathons, Logos

 	ethics - appeal to ethics
 	- passion - appeal to passion
 	- Logic - appeal to logic

 	- Paul Graham: when things are hard, people who suspect its non-sense generally keep quiet
