### Profile

 	- Partner at BlackStone

### Personal effectiveness

 	- the bigger the goals the more significant the consequences
 	- since you can only do one important thing at a time, always pick the most important one to start with
 	- most important lessons are learned at inflection points between when failure turns into success
 	- the best executives are made not born, they absorb info, study their own experiences, learn from mistakes and evolve
 	- The goal of education (questioning and thinking) as a discipline is to learn how to think, it only ends when you die
 	- there are as many realities as individuals, study more individuals
 	- find a great mentor
 	- Cultivate inner fortitude: Helps preserve morality and ethics in the face of fear and greed
 	- The harder the problem the more limited the competition
 	- The first job is foundational. Always look for one with a steep learning curve and strong training.
 	- when caught in a tight spot, don't become fixated on your own problem but on someone else's
 	- when seeing a huge transformative opportunity don't worry that no one else is pursuing it.
 	- never get complacent
 	- make decisions when you are ready not under pressure
 	- objectively assess the risks of every opportunity.

### On finance and trading

 	- master uncertainty: finance is a dynamic world where you will need to adjust to situations, people and new information quickly
 	- build a model to explain a certain phenomena and then test it
 	- do not mistake interest in making money versus interest in psychological comfort
 	- market tops

 	loose credit conditions and a rising tide
 	- buyers generally overconfident
 	- number of people you know who become "accidentally" become rich
 	- number of IPOs increase at the top, so does the valuations and size

 	- market bottoms

 	very hard to bring companies to IPO
 	- difficult to detect
 	- markets are declining and economy weakens
 	- most buy too early or under-estimate the severity of recessions
 	- usually takes a year or two for market to get out of recession. even then asset value takes time to recover
 	- risk is the least after a crash
 	- best time to enter is after position has experienced 5-10% recovery from a crash

 	- practice discipline and sound risk assessment

 	wait till the cycle fully plays out

 	- Cycles are powered by supply and demand characteristics

 	understand and quantify them
 	- e.g. real estate top is when building is valued significantly above replacement cost

 	- Sometimes a trend especially negative ones will exhibit symptoms spread across various territories (escalating land prices Spain, India and US prior to 2008)

### On building a company

 	- fund raising from an LP for a new fund you are starting yourself will be harder than the prior company whom the LP already has a relationship with.
 	- make sure there is not sole decision maker for important decisions to avoid getting blind sided
 	- Accessing an idea

 	big enough for you to devote your life
 	- unique enough as an offering that people will want it
 	- timing must be right

 	- transition from gut to system during the middle of the life cycle to continue further scaling
 	- a business is an integrated system. Understand how one part works by itself as well as in relationship with other parts. Information is the most important asset in business

### On management

 	- being a strong and accurate accessor of talent is the most critical skills of entrepreneurship.
 	- look for cultural fit.
 	- Get the candidate into conversation mode
 	- its as hard to start and run a small business versus a big one. Choose one with potential to be huge. Why waste time asking for 5-10 million USD when you can ask for 50-100 million USD?
 	- find people who sense problems, design solutions and takes the business in new directions
 	- be proactive in addressing personal differences over day to day operations

### On deal making

 	- ultimately comes down to a few key critical points
 	- clear away the clutter and focus on these points to be effective
 	- learn to slow things down
 	- practice intense listening
