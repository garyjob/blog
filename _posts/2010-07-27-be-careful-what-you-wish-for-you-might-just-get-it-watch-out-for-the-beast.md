During this same period last year, I was sitting in the park on the grass. I was figuring out how to proceed forward from where I was to where I wanted to be. It felt very similar to backpacking. As usual the destination was but a vision in the mind; a general direction, an inspiration, altogether vague and abstract.

Just for fun, I mentally projected my vision into the future seeking the path that I will need to take to get from where I was to where I want to be. It was almost like an out of the body experience.  Sian call this astral projection. There was a prior occasion when she brought me on one back in London. It turned out somewhat weird since this totally unfamiliar monk intruded into both our visions. Out of curiosity, she left me alone with this monk. The monk revealed nothing but just sat there on this imaginary grass patch smiling merrily while looking far into the horizon. It was as if he knew something that I didn't and was altogether quite entertained by this notion. He soon got up on his feet and left that patch of grass. Sian came back shortly and guided me back from the astral planes.

Nevertheless that prior occasion was not as psychically charged as this one.  After sitting in meditation for an hour or two, I must have unknowingly stirred up this beast that had previously gone to slumber. In its awoken and agitated state, it bellowed and torn the fog asunder. The path forward suddenly revealed itself and its familiar voice  started this totally new incantation in my head. At first it felt foreign and unnatural but with the passing of each iteration in the head, this incantation became louder and more fanatic, gaining a life of its own. Finally it over powered the reality priorly in existence and became reality itself. Once again I was unfortunate enough to be inflicted with the beast.

"I want more sales leads! I demand for more sales leads! Give me what I want! Give it to me now! .... " this voice in my head bellowed  and the flesh could only but obey the demands of this voice in the head. Ironically back in 2008, this same voice demanded that I journey westwards. It got content and went quiet when I finally reached and saw the Atlantic ocean with my very own eyes.

Roughly 12 months has past since that day in the park. Magically, out of the ether what that beast demanded for it got. The flesh however was pushed to the limits heeding the beckoning of its voice. Once again after months of raging in the head, it suddenly went silent. Good riddance for the time being at least. However intuition tells me this beast is laying low somewhere in the midst of cooking up god knows what. The signs are there, I just have to decipher what it is.
