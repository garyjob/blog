### The Mission

Building and optimizing the entire infrastructure (hardware and software) from ground up with autonomous self driving as the mission
### Mission and decision making

Design decisions are made with trade off between functionality and cost to achieve the mission while keeping cost in control

 	- Lidar is not useful when cameras are available
 	- driving cars with HD mapping makes the entire operation brittle since actual road conditions can change

### Operating structure

 	- Data Team
 	- Hardware Team
 	- Software Team

### The Data model

[![](https://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/data_infrastructure.jpg)](https://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/data_infrastructure.jpg)

 	- Cars on roads are constantly collecting new data
 	- New data is being utilized to train and improve neural network model
 	- New improved model is constantly being deployed back to the car to improve self driving
 	- Real world data provides visibility into long tail scenarios that simulated data cannot. Simulating long tail scenario is an intractable problem

 	- Balancing between data model and software

 	Neural network is suitable for problems that are hard to solve by defining functions / heuristics
 	- Simple heuristics are better handled through coding in software

### Future revenue model

Robo-taxi that will disrupt the ride-sharing space.

 	- Consumer car - USD0.60 / mile
 	- Ride sharing - USD 2-3 / mile
 	- Telsa Network - USD 0.18 / mile

Main challenges:

 	- Legal - need more data and processing time to get approved
 	- Battery capacity
 	- Social norms around robo taxi
