## Key Points

 	- Habits are one way the brain learns complex behavior
 	- habit forming products increase Customer Life Time Value (CLTV)
 	- Customers of habit forming products are relatively price insensitive
 	- Viral cycle time -

 	time it takes for user to invite another user
 	- higher user engagement levels - more visits per day > grow faster than competitors

 	- Older Habits are more resilient than New Habits  - LIFO
 	- Habit potential

 	Frequency
 	- Perceived utility

 	- Vitamins versus Painkiller

 	Habit formed over time could transform a vitamin into a pain killer
 	- Habit forming technologies are both vitamins and painkillers

 	- Types of Product Creators

 	Peddler
 	- Facilitator
 	- Dealer
 	- Entertainer

## The model

### Trigger

 	- habits are built upon
 	- External triggers

 	put yourself in their shoes to understand the task they want accomplished

 	- Internal Triggers

 	5 whys - till arriving finally at a basic emotion

### Action

 	- increasing motivation is expensive
 	- reducing effort is easier
 	- must be easier than thinking
 	- identify desire and use technology to take out steps

#### Motivations

 	- Seeking pleasure and avoiding pain
 	- Seeking hope and avoiding fear
 	- Seeking social acceptance and avoiding social rejection

#### Effort

Subjected to users current situational context

 	- Money
 	- Physical effort
 	- Brain cycles
 	- Social deviance
 	- Non-routiness

#### Autonomy

 	- implicit choice of doing things the old way
 	- a new more convenient way to do things

### Variable Reward

 	- Tribe - who it comes from
 	- Hunt - material outcome of action
 	- Self - perception of self mastery

### Investment

 	- Reciprocation - humans treat machines like humans too
 	- Escalation of commitment
 	- Cognitive dissonance
 	- leads to improvement of service for the specific user which increases the likelihood of  users returning

 	content
 	- data
 	- followers
 	- reputation
 	- skill

## Habit Testing

 	- Identify

 	who are the product's habitual users?
 	- Based on frequency of use

 	-  Codify

 	make sure at least 5 percent of users will find your product valuable enough to use as much as you predict they would
 	- Habit Path: a series of similar actions shared by your most loyal users

 	codify they steps they go through

 	where they come from
 	- decisions they make when registering
 	- sift through data for similarities

 	- Modify

 	identify ways to nudge new users down the same Habit Path taken by devotees
 	- Cohort tracking

## Enabling Technologies

 	- Technology wave

 	Infrastructure - when technology makes an existing behavior easier
 	- applications built on top of infrastructure - causes more people to exhibit behavior
 	- subsides - the next technology wave starts forming

 	- Look for Nascent Behavior

 	discover apps occupying the first screens on mobile devices
