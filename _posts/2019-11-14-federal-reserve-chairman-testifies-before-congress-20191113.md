### Economic indicators

 	- Inflation is at all time low
 	- Unemployment is at all time low
 	- Consumer confidence is at all time high
 	- Productivity has slowed down
 	- Business  investments and manufacturing has contracted

### Key take aways

 	- China is doing a responsible job deleveraging it's economy. This is one of the key drivers of economic slow down around the world apart from the ongoing US/China trade war
 	- Global deflationary trend drivers

 	partly driven by worldwide aging population which sees increased savings rates and lesser consumption
 	- automation and globalization

 	- Ballooning US debt is a concern. Need to bring debt growth rate below productivity growth rate to be sustainable in the long run
 	- The effects of the sugar rush from the 2017 tax cut is still evident within the economic system
 	- Negative interest rates only makes sense in a large economies where growth is really sluggish. That is not the case for US where growth is strong and productivity is still high.
 	- Need to focus on education to prepare work force for the global economy
 	- US GDP is growing at 1.5% of which 0.5% is contributed by immigration
