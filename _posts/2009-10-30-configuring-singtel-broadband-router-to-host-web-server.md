Just last night in an attempt to once again familiarize myself with networks, I started experimenting with my SingTel BroadBand Router.

I basically connected this laptop of mine to the network and logged into the router's web interface. Next, I assigned this laptop of mine to the Demilitarized Zone aka DMZ.

Doing this thus puts my laptop in front of the firewall that protects my home's LAN from external intrusion.

My Laptop gets assigned a new IP address and a new default gateway. Next I rebooted my laptop.

Once done, I could started my web server. During the instance if any one knew what was my IP address, He or she could have accessed my webserver.
