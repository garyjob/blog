In this drunken state of mind where logic fails, I hereby state this unqualified statement that "there comes a point in time in the life of man when the thrill of acquiring wealth, fame and power far surpasses the thrill which comes with the successful pursuit of women."

Should a man upon having reached this stage in life have found a woman for himself which he could deem as a soul mate, he can indeed be considered a fortunate man.

A man otherwise is a man who have to eventually accept the fact of his aloneness. Try as he might, there will always exist this inconquerable gap between him and his mate to be. As such mate will never be deemed to be a soul mate but rather a mate of convenience.
