## Legal concerns

 	- 409A to ensure against crazy discounts to employees
 	- company want to grant options to team as low as possible so they can have the benefit from joining
 	- don't give away the 409A to investors that would screw up the valuation

## Valuation = Income / Risk

 	- either decrease risk or increase income
 	- get MOUs
 	- M&A very hard to use to push values. Different acquirers are only able to capitalize assets they are buying to certain extents

## Hot air valuations - patent or number of engineers

 	- only useful if it's stopping a large player from getting to market
 	- need to fight violations to keep patent
 	- Company needs to own patent for it to be valuable for investors
 	- provional patents are a liabilities as they require further resources to be issued
 	- eye balls that cannot be monetized

 	Not really valuable

## There is a reasonable valuation of projects at different stages

 	- Anything not technology or hardware leads to valuation below 1x of revenue - IOT is hard to value. Is a front loaded hardware play but software play eventually
 	- Towards later stage startups ESOP / Fair market valuation versus investment will converge
 	- convergence is based on successful team execution

## Cost Approach to valuation for issuing ESOP

 	- Salary.com useful for making research on cost approach to monetization
 	- expenses incurred since inception
 	- founder salary 60K to 120K per year range
 	- PAR value is meaningless - it's just a plug number
 	- Post revenue switch to cashflow valuation model

## Ensure against red flags in ur cap table

 	- need to have 10-15million shares outstanding
 	- smells and feel like silicon valley
 	- get an attorney who understands Silicon Valley to do it
 	- east coast versus west coast financial instruments they like

## Pre-money and Post Money valuations

 	- investors are always thinking of post money
 	- founders are always thinking of pre-money valuation
 	- talk to investors using post money
 	- usually 20% dilution per round
 	- Series C usually leads loss of company control
 	- ventures usually want a bigger chunk when they come in early
 	- need to go after increasing valuation
 	- need to model CAP table before fund raising and share it
 	- Founders who gave up too much equity early on makes the company unfundable
 	- Funds older than 5 year old they can't fund new ones
 	- Each fund last for 10 years
 	- VCs need to raise more funds to invest
 	- Watch out for

 	investors want to be able to convert to common shares results in Full participating
 	- watch out for liquidation preferences - 2X or 3x
 	- lesser participation more aligns the investors with founders
 	- full participating investors will want to exit earlier versus founders

## VC method

 	- Comps / Peer group's revenue multiple to get valuation - need to spend a lot of time to build peer groups and prove the peer group multiplies
 	- social media valuation is slowly coming down
 	- which year become profitable = when most likely to exit
 	- they apply valuation of earliest most likely to exit by 50% discount and then apply risk discount
 	- in the valley they only care about revenue growth and not income
 	- SAAS don't make money they are putting money back in the business
 	- Revenue todos

 	don't use top down revenue projections
 	- use bottom up revenue projections

 	- Need to see where the holes are and try to break it. Need to ensure the valuation is defendable
 	- projectiond keep rolling down as time passes along and things start playing out
 	- they will do due diligence

 	call bullshit and drive down valuation
