Apparently it seems the Google Map API isnt all that stable after all. On and off while loggin into my site [ThingsToDoSingapore.com ](http://ThingsToDoSingapore.com )I encounter this problem of  GMap2 not defined.

GMap2 is apparently the core object class that one instatiates a map object from. I have been researching over the internet to find a work around this problem but it seems this is a very common problem that one faces when using the Google Map API.

This is very painful indeed as it is costing me traffic volumn. Ouch!
