This book describes how the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis transpired.
### Impacted countries

 	- South Korean
 	- Indonesia
 	- Thailand
 	- Malaysia
 	- Singapore
 	- Hong Kong
 	- China

### Key lessons

 	- Only 2 of these three conditions can be allowed to be true without causing inflationary recession

 	Fixing the currency exchange rates against other reserve currencies
 	- Control over domestic interest rates
 	- Control over capital inflow

 	- On foreign capital flows

 	huge volume of foreign capital flows into a country

 	economic growth rate increases
 	- inflation rate stays low

 	- huge volume of foreign capital flows out of country

 	economic growth rate decreases
 	- inflation rate goes up

### Common pattern across countries

#### The build up

 	- Long periods of high export lead GDP growth attracts high levels of foreign investments. Huge volume of foreign funds originated from Japan which was having a very loose monetary policy
 	- Countries peg their exchange rates to reserve currency to ensure stable prices for both imports of raw materials and exports value added products
 	- Countries currencies are not reserve currency, hence foreign loans were denominated in foreign currency
 	- Excessive leverage within the country by domestic parties who take on short term loans denominated in foreign currencies at lower interest rates to finance long term projects that generate returns in domestic currencies

 	Stocks are purchased with borrowed money. These stocks are then further used as collaterals to borrow more money
 	- Real estate are purchased with borrowed money. These real estates are then further used as collaterals to borrow more money

 	- Moral hazard due to corruption of financial system

 	banks are arm twisted to finance projects that are not financially viable by governments and politicians

#### The economic headwinds

 	- countries face increasing export market pressure

 	Competition at the low end of the export markets from China
 	- Competition at the high end of the export markets from Japan

 	- Japanese government instructs central bank to tighten monetary policy to reduce real estate. This severely restricted liquidity from Japan and reduced availability of short term foreign loans to affected countries

#### The crash

 	- Borrowers within these countries increasingly experienced difficulties rolling over their foreign denominated short term loans to finance their long term illiquid domestic projects
 	- Many of them started defaulting on their loans
 	- Foreign investors started getting spooked and started withdrawing their funds or refusing to allow their loans to roll over
 	- Non-performing loans builds up amongst banks within these countries
 	- Capital flight continues causing downward pressure on the exchange rates of these countries
 	- Countries continued defending their exchanges rates by buying up their own currency and selling off foreign reserves (assets held in foreign currencies)
 	- Countries deplete their foreign reserves and are unable to uphold their exchange rates. Since most debts are denominated in foreign currencies, they are not able to print money to pay off these loans.
 	- The economy grinds to a halt and hyper-inflation occurs within their financial system at this point

 	domestic production stops and locally produce foods is no longer available for sale
 	- due to shortage of foreign reserves imported products become very expensive in local currency

 	- Countries approach IMF for loans to tide through this liquidity crunch.
 	- IMF steps in and with a lack of understanding of the economic patterns imposes these requirements:

 	Countries required to impose high domestic interest rate. It has the effect of further reducing the money supply within these countries causing more defaults domestically.
 	- Countries will reform the financial systems to remove cronyism lead financing

 	- Riots ensures and Anti-establishment governments get elected in some countries

#### The recovery

 	- IMF releases the misstep in policies and relents

 	Countries lower their domestic interest rates to increase liquidity within their financial system
 	- Countries allow their exchange rates to float freely

 	- Relatively cheap asset prices within these countries starts attracting foreign investments again
