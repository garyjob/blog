#### Overview

Persuasion is not about convincing people to do something they don't want to do but to give them a reason for them to do something they want to do.

When you cannot change reality, the only thing you can do is to change the way its interpreted.

#### Top level framing models for persuasion

- Flight versus Flight- Us versus Them- Right versus Wrong

#### Perception of reality

- Seeing is not believing. Seeing is belonging- People want to belong more than they want to be right
