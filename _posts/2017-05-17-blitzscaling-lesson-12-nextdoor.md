## Targets to aim for sequentially

 	- growing engagement

 	figure out why they would want to use a product over and over again
 	- build a product that people would want to use twice a day
 	- Next door has an average 40% daily engagement rate in their user base
 	- do things that don't scale

 	manually try to find suppliers before moving on to find buyers

 	- scale up quality of engagement
 	- be skeptical until proven beyond a doubt across all spectrum that hypothesis is valid
 	- Set a high bar on what engagement means

 	allows a neighborhood to only continue if more than 10 people use it

 	- growth

 	figure out how to drive user acquisition
 	- fifure how to maintain the high quality of engagement
 	- pick a target segment and overserve them before moving on to expanding to more segments

 	- monetization

 	figure out how to capture value after achieving critical mass
 	- Google Ads - demand fulfillment since people already want the stuff n are searching for it
 	- Facebook Stream injection - demand generation since people might not know they want the stuff but would want it if they know it exist

## Scaling in order

 	- Scale engagement
 	- scale user base
 	- scale monetization
 	- scale technology
 	- scale people

## Coaching / Leaderships

 	- Bill Campbell

 	Situational awareness

 	can identify pattern very fast and provide the advice
 	- been on the board of Apple, Google, Amazon

 	- Great leader himself

 	people want to follow him

 	- Seeing each player's strength clearly and hanging advice based on the player's profile

## Key points

 	- things that work well during a downturn will work well during an upturn
 	- cost structure commitments

 	be wary of fixed cost long term commitments - Rent
 	- employing another full time staff
 	- ok to take risk where costs are Capped n one off

 	- to do things sequentially because only have a small team and cannot pursue all goals simultaneously
