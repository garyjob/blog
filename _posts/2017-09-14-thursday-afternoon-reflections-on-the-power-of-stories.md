Words convey meaning. Meaning leads to changes in the interpretation of the current moment. Changes in interpretation changes the internal narrative of the recipients with regards to her identity.  Stories in their narrative form are especially power when the audience resonates fully with the protagonist in the story

stories must have a human face (just one) as its protagonist.

 	- Mother Teresa: when I see the masses I look on with inaction, when I see suffering of the individual person I feel compelled to act
 	- Joseph Stalin: The death of one is a tragedy, the death of many a statistics

A Mission Statement must necessarily come accompanied with a human story that elicits an strong emotional response from its recipients to align the organization and those around it.
