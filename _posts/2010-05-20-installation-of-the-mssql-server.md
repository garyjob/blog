Just a few days ago, I managed to get a cracked copy of the MSSQL 2008 server from Ibraheem, I decided to try and install it on one of my laptop just for fun. Apparently during the installation process there were so many configurations to be made I missed out on something. So basically at the end of the day, the screenshot below shows the exact configuration I decided upon to get myself a basic standalone MSSQL server with the client tools to manage the MSSQL server.
