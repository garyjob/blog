I was in the office of the orthodontist discussing pricing with administrator for my teeth alignment procedure

The retention sessions came pre-packaged as part of the fees. Deciphering the words used by the administrator it occurred to me it was not a mandatory part of the actual package but a highly recommended inclusion ( default settings). The additional fees amounted to 10% on top of original fees which was USD7,034

The administrator mentioned due to referral by my dentist I am eligible for a discount (reciprocal bias hijack)

when I proposed that the additional add on be removed the administrator joked and said I wouldn't want to do that and proposed that we continue on to see what the full estimate was before having it removed (insistence)

after the final quote was presented, I insisted that it be removed. When she refused, I persisted by clarifying why it was so important to have it included now. She gave a persuasive response.

I persisted still to ask for it removed and asked if there were any other concerns I am not aware of. Not being able to find more reasons, she mentioned she would have to check with the Doctor (deferring to higher authority by her / by-passing to her higher up bye)

The Doctor could not provide any stronger reason and thus subsumed to my request.

We later spent a good 30mins configuring the cost schedule with the help of my remote insurance agent to my satisfaction
