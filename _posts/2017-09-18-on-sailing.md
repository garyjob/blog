Sailing can be drawn as a very close analogy to life

Sometimes you get fair winds and you could sail in the direction of your destination. Other times you get foul winds and you are forced to make sideways and detours. Patience and sustained intent eventually gets you there so long as you are clear about the destination you have in mind.
