 	scarcity
 	- exclusivity

 	- Triggers

 	Ideas strongly associated with items frequently found the environment gets triggered more often. Pick common objects in a user's environment that is not already laced with other meanings.
 	- The more specific a trigger the higher the likelihood of triggered action.
 	- Choose trigger right close to the proximity of the intended action

 	- Emotions

 	Emotions that excites will be more likely to drive the recipient towards an action than those that.

 	Useful emotions: Awe, excitement, anger, fear
 	- Not useful emotions: sadness, hopelessness

 	- Associate the idea with emotions

 	- Public

 	Monkey see, monkey do. Figure out how to make users activities more visible to those around them so that they could copy his action. A private action is unlikely to get copied
 	- Choose stimulus that others can't help but notice.

 	- Practical Value

 	help transfer huge amounts of contextual information to recipient
