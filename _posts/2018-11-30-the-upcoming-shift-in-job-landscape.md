As technological innovation and disruption continues to happen in various industries, more and more sections of traditional deadend jobs continue to get automated away. A shift in mindset towards jobs becomes necessary.

With higher man to output ratio made possible through leverage of technology, companies trends towards being smaller and more nimble, their outputs more differentiated in market, and the environment more organic.

In the prior era, the individual sees himself as generic bolts to be fitted into one of the many predefined Giant engines (businesses)  and thereafter, unless he operates at the upper echelons of the machinery, close himself off to the rest of the environment.

In the new era, the individual is constantly scanning the environment for changes to figure out what new oasis has open up and which one is dying down and thereafter moves from one watering hole to another.
