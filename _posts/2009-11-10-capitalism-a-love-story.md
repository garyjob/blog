I just saw the greatest love story ever on Capitalism. It is a must watch, extremely satirical, but accurate and information giving us a good overview of why the US is in the state it is in today.

It is puzzling sometimes wondering how come humans do not conform to the normal behavior of natural predators. It was ever reported that lions, tigers and wolves normally leave their prey alone once they  are done with their meals.

Are we really cursed with the inexplicable drive towards converting every known resource on earth into dollars and cents?  What the  hell is wrong with us?
