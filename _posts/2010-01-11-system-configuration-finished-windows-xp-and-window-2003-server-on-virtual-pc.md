After hours infront of my laptop, I have managed to install Windows Xp on it with the necessary developement environment to do my work  while I am over in Korea(Apache, MySql PHP, SMPT, FTP.) Even more than, I have even managed to setup virtual PC on my computer. Next thing next, I will most likely be installing Windows 2008 Server to allow testing for my Moodle System which uses Windows Active Directory via LDAP.

All is looking good thus far.
