 	- When under strong attack - lead with our strength by focusing on where we are strong at
 	- Types of managers

 	**Know-how managers**: people are who the specialist in their area of operation

 	The output neighboring organizations under his/her influence

 	- **Supervisors**: people with ownership/accountability to specific decision

 	The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his/her supervision or influence

 	- A responsive company have fewer levels of managers:

 	leverage on electronic communication medium
 	- this helps horizontally scale one of the key managerial activities - the role of information dissemination

 	- One on One sessions

 	mutual education and exchange of information
 	- didactic management: always ask one more question until both feel they have gotten to the bottom of the problem

 	- Importance of the Growth mindset

 	If you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage

## Leverage

 	- Creating high output depends on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage
 	- a team will perform well only if peak performance is elicited from the individuals in it

 	levers: training, motivation
 	- choosing language/compiler that allows engineers to solve more problems per hour of programming

 	- Watch out for negative leverages

 	Meetings are a leverage mechanism
 	- come prepared for meetings so as not to waste company time/resources
 	- Avoid micro management

 	activity leverage is too low
 	- subordinates start coming to you with every single decision that could have otherwise been made independently

 	- select activities of the highest leverage from other comparable ones
 	- Supervisory roles:

 	optimal 6 - 8 subordinates - half an hour dedicated to each person per week spread across multiple activities

 	otherwise either over-leveraged or under leveraged

 	- Dealing with interruptions

 	can be clustered and dealt with using a pre-prepared FAQ

## Production

 	- Time management

 	work backwards from a required deadline to know the critical milestones you must meet and when

 	- Production operations

 	Process - manufacture
 	- Assembly - put the manufactured parts together
 	- Test - make sure the entire product is acceptable

 	Incoming or receiving inspection - costly
 	- in process inspection - sampling based and not perfect

 	detect and fix at the lowest-value stage
 	- Use paired indicators - to avoid over optimizing for one and under optimizing another part of the process

 	- Cost

 	Figure out alternatives
 	- understand trade offs exist
 	- figure out the most cost effective way to deploy your resources
