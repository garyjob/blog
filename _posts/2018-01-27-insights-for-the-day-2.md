After spending days investigating the features and talking with avid users of both Facebook and SnapChat, it occurred to me the fundamental difference consumer wise is that Facebook helps you connect to the content you feel interested in while SnapChat helps you connect to the people you are feel intimate with.

The main challenge Facebook face in going after the second value proposition is its disruption to the structure of its current revenue model.

This marked shift in Facebook’s mission might be a sign that the next generation of the Web will be more focused on relationships than on content.

Facebook’s share price will likely experience a slight dip in the next few quarters during the Mission shift announced by Mark Zuckerberg

The difference in technology position they are betting on in the long term is that Facebook is banking on VR while SnapChat is banking heavily on AR
