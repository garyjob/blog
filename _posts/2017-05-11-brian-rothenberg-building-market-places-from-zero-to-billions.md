### [![](http://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4943.jpg)](http://garyteh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4943.jpg)Key points for building market places

 	- The only thing that matters: Build liquidity - the first one there wins

 	sellers can expect their items will sell
 	- buyers can expect to buy items at price they can accept
 	- cross side network effects - one side drives the other side

 	- Always start with building building Supply first

 	seek out inefficient, fragmented markets that you can roll up
 	- look for fragmented + high friction for supply sign up
 	- pick method that works for your target market
 	- Methods

 	trojan horse strategy - provide immediate value through the offer of the use of a tool - SAAS model

 	can help bootstrap the project
 	- Eventbrite was a event management SAAS model before it became a market place for events

 	- Manual hack #1 - Yelp

 	Web crawling
 	- Clean data and categorize
 	- pull out key insights and distribute
 	- upload data into directory and invite service providers to claim their profiles

 	- Brute force

 	hire 300+ remote team

 	- Plug into existing liquid network
 	- PR + timing
 	- get customers to promote your brand

 	TripAdviser

 	- Challenges

 	In the short run supply is always the challenge
 	- In the long run demand is the bottleneck

 	- Network effects create virtually impenetrable barriers to entry

 	retention grows
 	- increasingly attractive economics
 	- reaching scale as fast as possible matters

 	- Competition

 	horizontals are going vertical
 	- horizontals that fail to go vertical lose market shares - craiglists
 	- moving forward focus on building niche networks
 	- technology shifts sometimes open new windows to attach horizontal market positions
 	- Winner either take most or takes all

 	- Operations

 	track satisfaction / separate NPS for both supply and demand side
 	- more satisfied demand side drives growth
 	- very powerful dynamic:

 	look for overlap between buyers and sellers

 	Uber / Lyft
