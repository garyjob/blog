**Behavioral advice**

 	- Be willing to live with ambiguity
 	- Be resilient

 	Maslow hierarchy of needs

 	Survival
 	- Security
 	- Social
 	- Self-esteem
 	- Self-actualization

 	- Be willing to live beyond stage three most of the time - surpass the need to be liked

 	- Don't be conflict adverse

**Dealing with the decision maker**

 	- When present with a proposal, don't ask for something specific in return but let the other person offer up an item for exchange
 	- Get the other person to commit first
 	- Always flinch when proposed something
 	- Never say yes to the first offer
 	- Ask for more than you expect to get
 	- Never be too eager to close the deal - they will give away half of his/her negotiating range
 	- Shut up and wait after delivering a rejection or delivering the details of a proposal
 	- Always negotiated in absolute numbers instead of percentages
 	- Convince them that you are the only one that could solve the problem

**Finding the decision maker**

 	- Ascertain the person you are dealing with is the actual decision maker
 	- Do not present yourself as the decision maker
 	- When possible always defer to higher authority. The more vague and abstract the better
 	- Seek to neutralize the other person's Higher Authority Gambit ( also watch out for good cop and invisible bad cop)

 	Appeal to their ego
 	- Get their commitment that they will take the proposal to the committee with a positive recommendation
 	- Use the qualified subject to close (assume close)

 	Example: let's sign the deal and put in the condition that it will be closed unless the following conditions occur

**Things to watch out for**

 	- The value of a service greatly diminishes after its been performed
 	- Negotiated your fee before you do the work

**Situations**

 	- Impasse

 	incomplete disagreement over one issue that could kill the whole agreement
 	- solution:

 	Propose to set aside the issue and discuss the other details based on the assumption that we will be able to sort out this issue as some point
 	- Create momentum by solving other smaller issues first

 	- Stalemate

 	both sides are still talking but not making progress
 	- Solution:

 	Create momentum by solving other smaller issues first
 	- Change the dynamics by altering one of the elements

 	- Deadlock

 	lack of progress frustrated both sides causing conversations to come to a halt
 	- Solution:

 	bring in a 3rd party

 	mediator
 	- arbitrator

 	- Keep an open mind about deadlocks - they happen sometime

**Tactics to watch out for and utilize**

 	- Good cop / bad cop
 	- Red Herring - they ask you for something impossible to divert attention so as to get something they want out of you
 	- Cherry picking - if on the receiving side, Don't deal

 	ask for itemized breakdown
 	- Learn so much about your competitors that they would see it as a waste of their time to go talk to them

 	- The deliberate mistake

 	They offer a good deal to you and then realize from their boss the terms no longer apply

 	- Acting dumb to make their feel OK and cause them to let their guard down
 	- Don't get thrown off by their tactics just focus on the concession you are targeting for

**Powers of concern**

 	- Reward power
 	- Coercive power
 	- Reverent power -

 	When people invoke the power of traditions. The power accumulated by doing things consistently
 	- How to neutralize it:

 	Demonstrate exceptions do exist
 	- Demonstrate that times have change

 	- Situational power

 	Always do enough research so that you can challenge the situation
