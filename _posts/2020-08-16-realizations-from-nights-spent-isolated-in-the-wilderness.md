There are only so many nights you can spend alone in isolation out in the wilderness before your brain fully discards all the faulty wirings imprinted by Hollywood's horror movies.

What's left is this primal realization that human is a very vicious predator perched pretty high up on the food chain. Further arm him with tools and he ends up right at the top of the food chain.

It is easy to forget about this fact when you have spent much of your life living in the city amongst other men following man made rules while attempting to play "civilized".

Between groups of men there always exist collaboration and competition for resources extracted from nature. There also exist this constant jostling of position, usually labelled "politicking", to gain more of these resources while exerting the same amount of effort. The bulk of the "stress" of "modern life" stems from "acquiring" what you need through the collective efforts of the group.

Between men and nature, the relationship appears simpler. The rules are pretty much fixed at the on set by nature. Man's primary task is to figure out if the season is conducive for the activity being undertaken. Nature's feedback is usually pretty immediate.
