**Highlights**

Choose a specific value and align your people, processes and culture to that value. Relentlessly build upon that value everyday.

Types of values

 	- Operational excellence
 	- Product leadership
 	- customer leadership

**Operational excellence**

Build up and optimize system to reliably and cheaply deliver what is expected. A perfect example is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo’s consideration where it’s competitors margin is its own profit.

**Product leadership **

To setup processes to stay at the leading edge of what the industry expects by constantly pushing technological boundary to make possible what was not priorly possible. To setup independent teams to tackle problems in the same domain such that products developed by an internal team are made obsolete by another internal team instead of another company. To consciously self-disrupt. Andy Grove’s intel is a perfect example.

**Customer leadership**

To empower your teams to deeply ingrain themselves into your customer’s processes such that integration between your customer and your company is seamless. Perfect example is JSlabs where the consultants are so seamlessly integrated with Edmodo there is close to no difference between JSlabs staff and Edmodo staff from Edmodo’s perspective.

**Key concerns**

Need to ensure the other 2 values are at least on par with industrial expectation at the moment
