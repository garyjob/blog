Strange... Much as I have tried to avert this bottleneck that I have perceived since last month, it seems inevitable that the bottleneck occurs.

Why is that out of all the 52 weeks available in a year, 4 clients commission their project and another 2 clients seek for technical support all within this second week of July. One friend is coming to visit Singapore another is already in Singapore.

I hypothesis that the world we live in is not static but ruled instead by a cosmic tidal. This should explain the Murphy law phenomena I observed, aka 80% of all significant events happen within 20% of the time span around us.
