Customers consider their engagement with a business as a one on one relationship while businesses consider their engagement with a customer as purely transactional. This divide is the cause of a lot of unsatisfied customers.

When purely operating within the transactional paradigm, the business is motivated to shave operating overheads. This results in the customer being forced to engage with a whole bunch of bots before they get the opportunity to actually interact with a person. And even then, they are forced to repeat the communication of their needs as they get transferred from one person to another within the organization.

As mentioned by Seth Godin, it is important to avoid the pitfalls of falling into purely operating from the transactional paradigm and attempt to stay the course of operating from the relationship paradigm. Technology should be used to enable the operator to more deeply engage with the customer rather than automating out of existence the human to human contact.
