Apaprently it seems the past few days I have been waking up with this feeling of having a hung over despite not even havving a drop of alcohol in the System. Must be the One-Piece Marathon I have been doing recently.

Today being a quiet day as it is, I have decided to do a major system overhaul on my new laptop. After much consideration, I have decided that it would be for the best if I have windows Xp installed on it instead. The new Windows 2008 server though is good for a testing environment due to the fact that its running on 64bits is not really compatible with some of the softwares I use for developing my stuff. Once done, I will  most likely be bringing my old laptop down to Sim Lim Square to have a hard disk upgrade. The current 70GB is clearly not sufficient. Ouch.

Pray keep my fingers crossed nothing major comes up and disrupts this overhaul process. It is like attacking a crab or prawn when it is shelling, a most vulnerable time.
