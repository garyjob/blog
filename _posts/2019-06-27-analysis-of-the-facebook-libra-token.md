### High level

 	- The launching of Libra Token will allow large swath of people access to banking
 	- It will also allow corporations with a huge stock pile of cash the access to alternate forms of investment

### Libra currency liquidity

Every Libra token that gets created is backed by a reserve of real assets. Close examination of partner balance sheet figures shows approximately USD148 billion dollars of cash and equivalent available for deployment right out the gates.

### Libra social impact

One of Libra's goals is to provide banking access to segments of the world's population that don't. Close examination of partners' reach to this segment of the world shows 7.9million people. This is not including the 204 million African Internet Users on Facebook.
