Basically I am lucky to be alive now and to be posting this thread on this forum. I was in the midst of crossing the road over a pedestrain crossing just now in front of Shaw Towers Bugis area at 8.30pm this evening.

Yes, It is common nowadays for impatient car drivers to drive their cars over the pedestrain crossings, while there are still pedestrain passing and the pedestrain lights are still green. It is totally understandable the phase of life is fast and everyone is rushing for time. But this particular driver was pushing the limits.

There I was crossing the road and car with license plate SFZ2873B did a right turn into the lane I was on. Expecting him to give way to me since the pedestrain light was still green and I had the right of the way, I was in for a terrible surprise.

He instead of slowing down stepped down on the accelerator and increased the speed of the car. Thankfully I jumped out of his way in time. Otherwise, who knows I might have lost one of my limps due to someone else's impatience.

Roads in Singapore are turning out to be very frightening nowadays.
