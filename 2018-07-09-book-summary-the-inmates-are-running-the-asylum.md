- Cheaper in the long run to be slow but build the proper user experience
 	- Fixating in a schedule and being forced to take short cuts without a clear vision in mind is bad
 	- Cheaper to figure out the experience before building it. The latter is like scalping with a chainsaw
 	- Code revisions due initial lack of clarity in the market inevitably scars the code
 	- listen to your users but use your own judgement to discern the product feature to build
 	- handing the reins over to the users results in the abdication of your vision
 	- abdication of your vision pulls you to the mainstream and results in the loss of differentiation
 	- if they believe if you vision they will be willing to wait for it anyway
 	- reality is strong enough to stand on its own feet. It does not need a devils advocate
 	- Distinguish clearly between task and goals
 	- goals are universal across time while tasks are transient

 	goals - company needs to make money
 	- tasks - need to write a report in windows power point

 	- there are personal goals and professional goals

 	personal goal - feel good and don’t look stupid
 	- professional goals - make sure boss gets his report and I don’t get fired
