### Key insights

 	- The underlying theoretical basis for Mindfulness practice is **Neural Plasticity**
 	- Every idea/thought/memory has a corresponding set of body sensation signature

 	thought: Anger
 	- sensation signature: Tight shoulder, increased heart rate

 	- The brain is conditioned to be caloric conservative

 	Neo-cortex / awareness tends to be spotty and selective
 	- most stimulus/response loop gets automated to the Limbic brain. Brain's habit starts forming overtime.
 	- In extreme cases, the habit coalescence into a false identity which the subject subscribes to, a.k.a. the narrative fallacy
 	- That is the threshold beyond when the Limbic brain tendencies becomes too strong for Neo-cortex override.

 	**Addiction** - off balanced dopamine pathways
 	- **Anxiety** - off-balanced adrenaline pathways
 	- **Ignorance** - signals from sensors not being acknowledged

 	- Constant directing of awareness results in further build up of neural connections between Neo-Coretex and the Limbic Brain, allowing for increased control over output response to environment.

 	gradually displacing pre-existing programming

 	- Constant practice of equanimity by active observation of sensory inputs and corresponding limbic action help calibrate limbic response overtime
 	- Mind has natural tendency to load memories/thoughts into system when 5 senses are not any state of intense stimulation
 	- Insight Meditation is the most caloric efficient exercise for calibrating the Limbic system through a process of reinforcement learning

 	As in training neural networks, comprehensive volumes of data needs to be made available for the Neo-Coretex to make the connection between Addiction, Anxiety, Ignorance and corresponding body sensation signature

 	- Speculations on **Satori** moments described by Monks:

 	Cause:

 	Extreme levels of concentration achieved in the state of meditation

 	-  Symptoms:

 	Extensive heat / throbbing is experienced in the forehead section between the eyes
 	- Blinding flash of white light even with eyes closed

 	- Bio-Mechanism:

 	Density of neural connection between Neo-Coretex and Limbic brain  crosses some arbitrary threshold
 	- cross wiring of **generic** brain cells commonly utilized for consciously processing sight to observing the inner system

 	similar to temporal LSD induced mental state but in this case permanent

 	- Religious terminology:

 	opening of the third eye

 	- System - Dharma

 	Sila: precepts and morality
 	- Samadhi: concentration and stability of mind on here and now
 	- Pranna: wisdom of self by knowing what is right now happening within the framework of the body.

 	- Three marks of existence

 	Anicca - Impermanance
 	- Dukkha - All things are unsatisfactory
 	- Anatta - No self
