Ingredients:

 	- half cup of Olive Oil
 	- 12 pieces of muscles
 	- 6 cloves of garlic
 	- dried pepper
 	- salt

Steps:

 	- slice up garlic
 	- bring a pot of water to boil, throw in 3 punches of salt
 	- bring half a cup of olive oil to boil in medium heat. throw garlic into oil to turn brown
 	- once the spaghetti is cooked, save a cup of water, drain the spaghetti
 	- pour water into pot, put in muscles stir till muscles are cooked
 	- pour Olive oil and garlic into pot
 	- serve spaghetti with sauce over it

Parameters of concern:

 	- wetness versus dryness of sauce percentage
 	- browned of garlic
 	- tenderness versus chewiness of pasta
 	- avoid high heat level to protect health properties of olive oil
