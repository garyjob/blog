 	- way of thinking

 	There is a strategy behind everything. Everything fits. Thinking this way taught me to compete in many things, not only take over but chess and arbitrage
 	- Empiricism says knowledge is based on observation and experience, not feelings
 	- Studying 20th century philosophy trains your mind for takeovers
 	- Chain thinking: just like chess, in any transaction, think of every single possible move and counter move
 	- always consider what might be the worst case scenario and then protect your downside while increasing your control
 	- a civilization starts to decline when a large part of its population stops working

 	- Icahn/Kingsley theory: focus the market's attention on the disparity in values and someone will buy you out

 	Take over strategy potential outcome after indicating it as a take over target

 	acquisition of shares by original suitor
 	- hostile challenger
 	- white knight  who will come and free up the locked up value

 	- Prefer stocks with limited downside exposure, gravitate towards out of favor stocks that had already been discounted by the market
 	- When analyzing a company, earnings does not always present a clear picture. Depreciation is paper losses. Cashflow presents a better picture. Key components to analyze

 	asset
 	- return on equity
 	- cashflow
 	- capitalization

 	- committed the mistake of just focusing on financial engineering to reduce cost, think about how to grow the business
 	- Did not realize after fully taking over a company that the revenue side of the business is usually circumscribed to external factors not under direct management control

 	- On negotiations

 	everything has to be negotiated
 	- threaten, continuously threaten by painting a very dire picture. This helps frame the alternative which you demand as something very very reasonable
 	- wear down your opponent
 	- answer a question with a question
 	- always push the deal as far as it can without blowing up
 	- wait until a company is so stretched in need of a deal before buying on the most favorable terms

 	- On goal setting

 	have no fixed goals
 	- see all the possibilities

 	- Princeton liberal arts eduction:

 	exposure to eclectic mix of human knowledge teaching a student how to think, explore and question rather than prepare them for a specific career
 	- the best thinkers will rise to the top of their chosen careers precisely because they have not limited themselves to narrow courses of study
