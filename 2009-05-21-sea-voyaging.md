I have always had this dream since childhood, to travelling around the world. Thus I did landwise.

However today i came across this site http://www.sailready.com

It was basically advertising this book revolving around subjects for sea voyaging. It reminded me very much of my all time favourite game, **Uncharted Water**.

I happened once again to come across this statement by Mark Twain. Each time I came across and read it to myself, I feel within me a strong surge of Joy. So I thought I should share it with you.
