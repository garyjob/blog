Recently I started using Photoshop intensively. More and more a need is there to do so in order to keep cost low.

Thankfully one night while having supper with Pasha, he unknowingly commented on how photoshop tutorials were so easily available over YouTube. What he said was totally true. You could just pretty much go about learning any aspects of a software you want to pick up over YouTube nowadays. No longer do you have to read through lines of ambiguous written instructions to understand what the hell is going on.
