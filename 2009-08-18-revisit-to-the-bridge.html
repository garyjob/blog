            <p>The other day while out wandering the streets in the evening, I hopped off some random bus and took a walk this time east wards. Strangely, I arrived with real intentions finally in the hearts of Tanjung Rhu.</p>
<p>I filled up my water bottle in the condomium area. Strangely I felt drawn to that bridge again. Thus I climbed up that secret stairway as I did before. It was Sunday. I felt goosebumps all over. I needed to face it. I walked along the length of the bridge. There was no longer any sight  of that pair of shoes. It has been delivered to where it should belong. I sat along the walkway facing the sea. The breeze  was strong.</p>
<p>In place of the pair of shoes was a string of flowers. It was white intermixed with purple. Someone else before me had paid this place a visit. I sat rolling my cigarettes feeling the breeze upon me. Long have I came to associate the wind with freedom. It goes where it will with regards neither for territorial boundaries nor rules. It fears nothing nor needs anything. It is been free fr a long long time.</p>
<p>I finally lit  my cigarette and took  a puff. What could his last moment have been like, I pondered long and hard. I related the incidant to Pasha the night before. He said it must have been very very dark. I wonder.</p>
<p>I sat there imagining in my mind, trying to see through his eyes the very last moments prior to his departure for the next step of his journey. I  drew a blank  as the stage of his arrival on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>It was hard to truly understand the intensity of his emotions and the flow of his thoughts from the period he left this sitting position I was in. Goosebumps once again broke out.</p>
<p>I finished smoking my cigarette and left the pack beside the flowers as offerings for  him.</p>
