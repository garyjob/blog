<h3>Key takeaways on White house press releases</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- White house has taken very decision steps since the start of the spread in China to limit the import of viruses within the US
- It has followed through with further travel bans of air travel from Europe
- The next step is the 15 day shelter at home notices as of 15th March 2020
- Its a trade off between financial markets turmoil and health system turmoil
- To reduce maximum potential casualties, White house has opted to drag out the time it takes for the virus to spread throughout the community through social distancing measures.
- The process can be modified to have each state go through its own bell curve of peaking
- When health facilities are not overload, healthcare workers can afford to provide the necessary level of care to patients so as to limit the number of fatalities
- In times of crisis, democratic systems after much bickering will align and perform execution with tremendous velocity. Private sectors will get mobilized to deal with the crisis as well.
- Crisis are opportunities to remove red tapes and refresh platforms that are otherwise outdated. This makes the system more robust and able to handle future scenarios
- Media do not always accurately report what is the official communication from the White House. When possible always seek out the original communication.
- Targeting to reopen the country by 12th April 2020, Easter
