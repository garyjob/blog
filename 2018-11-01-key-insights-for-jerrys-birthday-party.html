            <h3>On web scraping</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- There is only a total of 180 million registered domains in the world
- There is a total of 120 billion web pages in the world
- .IO is the most popular top level domain right now in the world
- make sure to buy up &quot;CompanyEntity&quot;Suck.com domain as they tend to get a lot of traffic
- Similarities comparison

pull out words on website's about us page and comparing with other website's about us page
- reduce total number of dimensional space to compute similarities - sample space 500,000 word
- K-Means as opposed to Cosine similarities is a cheaper approach
- still need humans to tag specific data sets

- Detecting structure in page

find the tables and row
- extract the values within the column, check if is

place
- person
- address

- tag all the rest of the content on the page as the same entity

- Approaches

pure machine - inaccurate
- pure human - not-scalable
- set process to mix of machine and human for optimal configuration

- On Distill Networks/Bots blocking

this company utilizes machine learning to detect for bots
- currently only 10 of 1000 fortune 1000 companies are using their service
- fat tail companies will have the resource and motivation to protect their publicly available data
- long tail companies will have neither the resource nor motivation to protect their publicly available data

<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Facebook uses collaborative filtering
- Most lucrative advertising audience are still North America Whites
- African demographic don't spend much which makes them really bad advertising targets but are really loyal users once acquired
- African demographic drive much of the music and culture
- To ensure optimize monetization spend as well as server resource, could use Facebook page like condition to filter for more lucrative demographics
- Short video is the trend now

SnapChat is considered messaging than video
- Instagram is in the space
- Tic Tak is in the space
- Differentiation is a challenge in this space

- iMessage is the largest competitor of Facebook Messenger. The former spans across East and West.
</code></pre>

<h3>On Venture Capital</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Founders might potentially get blocked from selling company by investors past trough of sorrow stage (typically 5 years in)
- Founders might want to exit while investors need to get their return multiples (4x minimal)
- Investors might seek to replace CEO to bring in a growth/scaling CEO as opposed to a product centric CEO
</code></pre>

<h3>On Mobile gaming</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Each games has a life span of 5-6years
