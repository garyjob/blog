 	- The more universal truths you uncover about the world, the less the number of moral opinions you will need
 	- In life, you will eventually be forced to decide between being somebody or doing something
 	- The unreasonable person adapts surrounding conditions to himself
 	- The straight path in your head turns to spaghetti in the real world vice versa
 	- The straight and narrow path grounded in truth seeking is the faster road to meaningful destinations
 	- Power handed to the untrained mind leads inevitably to mental damage
 	- The ability to see reality as it really is, in minimally deluded ways, leads inevitably to the earning of authority
 	- A CEO's job is to interpret external realities for a company, A.G. Lafley

 	survive a lack of incoming empathy
 	- generate a positive atmosphere and empathy for others under your "information protection" umbrella
 	- A startup team of two is better than solo entrepreneurs due to the sharing of "information parenthood"

 	- Idealism believes in change and creates believers who don't change whereas the opposite is true

 	The idealist goes into Zen Retreat and remains unchanged after he is done
 	- The realist starts a business and is forced to change

 	- Path to freedom

 	Integrating the self (addiction) and the shadow (aversions) to cover your whole personality
 	- Myer Briggs cognitive function

 	first four functions represent your self
 	- last four functions represent your shadow - usually triggered by stress

 	- Status

 	If status doesn't matter to you, it becomes available to you as a tool to control those whom status does matter
 	- consciously cultivate away this felt need

 	- The easiest way to figure out someone is to look at the information they choose to consume
 	- Handling information

 	Truth telling

 	requires you to calmly separate your feelings from facts and tell yourself the truth before you tell others

 	- Cold blooded listening

 	listen for the data behind heated words
 	- don't take what you hear  about your personality as worth responding to
 	- freely draw your own conclusion about the data received

 	- Dissemination

 	the larger the group the fewer the key beliefs allowed to be conveyed
 	- at the level of human civilization use extremely simple but very fertile fill-in-the-blanks messaging

 	- Handling negotiation

 	most work is done away from the actual negotiating table
 	- Discovery pre-work conversation to tease out what people know and the trust relationship
 	- the more there is that mutually greed upon, the less there is to negotiate
 	- ignore sunk cost

 	- Choose to be effective instead of being liked
 	- On money

 	aim to be anti-fragile
 	- even millionaires are stuck in the psychology that the money is transient
 	- salary men are stuck in the illusion that the pay check will extend indefinitely into the future
