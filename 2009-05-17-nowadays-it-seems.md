Nowadays, it seems more and more that I wake up feeling aches here and there instead of feeling refreshed. 

Nowadays, it seems that rather than being free of any burden, these loads just seems to add themselves on to me more and more. 

Nowadays, it  seems that which used to be fun and entertaining has became boring and lifeless. 

Nowadays, it seems that there are more thing than 24 hrs a days can handle.
