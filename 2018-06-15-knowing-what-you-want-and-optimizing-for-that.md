While chatting with Adi today, I realized two huge reason why people continue showing up for work is because of habit and fear.

I recalled this irony I read somewhere else where people started out wanting to change the world but ended up becoming really wealthy but never really achieving what they originally set out to do. Its a tragedy.

A few symptoms resulting from a lack of clarity in what you want are FOMO and the need of keep up with the Jones.

If you judiciously worked back from what you want to what you need to do, you will very quickly realize there are a lot of things you are doing now that might be totally redundant. Dropping of these redundant efforts will immediately increase you overall quality of life by freeing up more time while simultaneously getting you closer to what you want.
