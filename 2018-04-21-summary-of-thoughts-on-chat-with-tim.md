 	visual element on the screen bounces around too much
 	- visual container's dimensions constantly changes during interaction due to introduction or removal of sub-elements. It gives the impression of an unwell thought out design

 	- Apple

 	only works on commodified technology
 	- when there is a compelling story to tell
