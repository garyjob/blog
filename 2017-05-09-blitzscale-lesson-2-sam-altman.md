### Founding teams

 	- Fatal conflicts

 	looking at having different vision
 	- looking at having the same role

 	- complementary pairs

 	technical owner
 	- business / product owner

### Best startups

 	- hired the least
 	- more people less effective
 	- 70 productive hours -

 	focus those hours on users
 	- focus on getting a really small number of users that really love the product

### Best founders

 	- The ability to clearly articulate the vision of what they are trying to do

 	easier to recruit
 	- easier to promote
 	- easier to raise fund

 	- determined
 	- passionate
 	- intelligence
 	- Effective in execution

### Early stage investing

 	- network effects at play

### Reason to launch quickly

 	- gain conviction
 	- Recognize a shift in the world
 	- see that people are constantly using the app over and over again even when being ridiculed by the masses
 	- figure our core metric that gets better 10% each week

### Pivots

 	- Found an opportunity that worked
 	- Built the stuff that you originally wanted to work
 	- Found an opportunity that could be monetized
 	- A rush to get an idea is very bad! If original idea is bad. Shut down the company, return the money and go travel the world for an organic idea

### Learnings

 	- The only most valuable pre-start experience is to join a really successful rapidly growing company so that you get put into different roles that you don't have much experience yet for

### Most critical mistake

 	- Not firing bad people fast enough

 	it hurts both the company and the employee by keeping them around longer
 	- the employee will stagnate during the time he is with the company
 	- explain clearly and be firm in the decision that the employee needs to go
 	- allow the employee to communicate his needs prior to departure

 	he could work from home while looking for a new position
 	- he could state that he is still working for the company while looking for a new position
 	- preparing the termination letter prior to communication only creates a highly adversarial environment

### Time window

 	- You only have a relatively short window of 20 years to be great.

 	between 25 - 45 years old
 	- focus on the one single problem that you really find important and want to solve
 	- learn how to become a great CEO then or
 	- join a company whose mission you really care about

### Valuation

 	- An employee should consider the valuation of the company 5 years down the road and how many percent of the valuation he owns.
 	- current valuation for a position that is illiquid is only a distraction
 	- valuation only means something when someone else is willing to pay for the shares at that valuation
