Apparently it seems [Winter In Venice](http://winterinvenice.co.uk) has been assigned a page rank of 0 by google and has been delisted from all search results on google. Interestingly this happened after we solved the session problem on fatcow hosting service.

So the thing we are attempting to do now is to get some really good quality linkages in from good sites. Fingers crossed. It is time to go site hunting.
