            <p>Precursor Ventures - Charles
Acceleprise VC - on sales process</p>
<ul>
<li>Whitney Sales- whitney@acceleprise.vc- Enterprise sales early stage investor B2B space- @thesalesmethod</li>
</ul>
<p>Whitney Graw</p>

<li>Becki Degraw- Wilson Sonsini, Partner- rdegraw@wsgr.com</li>

<p>Acrew Capital</p>
<ul>
<li>Lauren Kolodny- Twitter @LaurenKolodny</li>
</ul>
<p>Do fewer things in terms of revenue stream. Do them better and faster.</p>
<p>Give a great example of the solution to the problem that a user is experiencing</p>
<p>Don't care about recognition on the Forbes list. Just focus on product, customer, revenue and team member</p>
<p>Show how business model and product strategy are closely linked are fit together.
Show how business model will scale to a 100 million dollars revenue in a year</p>
<p>How to get laggard industry to adopt the technology</p>
<p>De-emphasize do-gooder (save the world) stuff in the content. It does not seem profitable</p>
<p>Show traction earlier in the deck</p>
<ul>
<li>brain treats companies with product and actual usage builds way more credibility earlier in the presentation- if don't have customer but have demo, show how it works- if product is strong start with product, if performance is strong start with performance- show bottoms up business model
this is how we work- this is how we charge- profit margin??</li>
<li>Looking for net negative churn- Like easier bets and very focused- elegant and simple means scale- complex means founder might need to spend a few million dollars to figure out their business model- Sales process- problem solving- project management- the larger organization being sold, the more they want to be told what to do.- record your calls so that you can reference it later on for product development and education- work your network in the early days- use twitter direct messaging- for engaging engineers, you won't be able to engage them directly.
use community development and content and APIS</li>
<li>handling price rejections
in early days not optimized for price- but to learn for use case- see early users for partners- use what you learn in the qualification and use that as reference for the price point- anchor to how much the problem is costing your company right now</li>
<li>let your early customers be your guide- Negotiating term sheets- Becki Degraw- Wilson Sonsini, Partner- rdegraw@wsgr.com- Types
preferred stocks- convertible notes- safes</li>
<li>components
Valuation- pre/post money valuation- option pool - dilutive to founders- liquidition preferences- board composition- stocket holder vetos/controls- investor rights</li>
<li>focus on how much you need till 12 to 18 months
the hiring plans- 90% shares- 10% option pool- help with negotiating the options pools</li>
<li>talk about how outstanding convertible and SAFEs are accounted for - pre-money valuation- Get legal council to prepare the cap table to see the dilution- preferred stock used to keep common stock cheap for employees
participating or non-participating preferred shares- participating gets to double dip after the preferred payout- usually only happens during down round or PE is involved- should not see it during initial round</li>
<li>Board
make sure to have odd number to avoid deadlock- smaller boards are good - keep it to as small as possible- hires or fires the CEO- financing transactions - new pool- M&amp;A transactions- Series A - common should control board- Series B - more balanced board common and preferred- Seed round - 3 directors- Series- 2 common directors - 1.5X voting rights- 1 seed director- 1 preferred director</li>
<li>Preferred investors will usually ask for board seat
negotiate down to observer</li>
<li>Prorate or information rights are reserved to major investors - cross a certain threshold- Founder re-vesting
usually during Seed stage and Series A</li>
<li>If founder puts in money
treat that as convertible note and convert at the next round- demand note - to get paid back during the next round- totally ok if it is a small amount in there- 200K easy versus 2 million- If raising less than 2 millino USD just use convertible or safe notes for seed stage</li>
<li>Put founders on a vesting schedule for optics purposes- US investors only what to invest in Delaware LLC Corps- Vesting is important for protecting company against vagrant founders and employees- We are in a company/founder friendly market right now
investors are doing things we haven't seem the doing in many years- putting down term sheets 2 months ago with nothing- need to get in earlier and earlier to beat the valuation from investors- create hype and interest</li>
<li>For small financing round - seed round
small amount of money- Use YC safe note</li>
<li>Million dollar Marketing campaign- Unit Economics- creative testing- Landing pages- media buying- metric
Cold traffic needs to convert at 2%- CPM needs to be lower than 20- Ads click through rate &gt; 3%- CPA 1.8- gross margin needs to be 70%- COGS less than 30%- 4000K impression- 5% add to cart</li>
<li>
<p>If has no prior competition - make really good videos- GrowthUniversity.IO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking for
100 million revenue in 10 years with 50% margin</p>
</li>
<li>Avoid the Total addressable market (TAM) trap
We have 15 people paying us- we acquired them for CAC XXX- we know their LTV right now to be X- we are going to spend X on Facebook, Google and LinkedIn for CAC XXX</li>
<li>Structure to use to follow based on lead investor
SAFE notes is cheaper and less expensive to issue and no maturity dates</li>
