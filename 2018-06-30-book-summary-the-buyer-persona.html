<h3>Differentiation</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- There is a difference between the buyer persona and the user persona

buyer: before sale
- user: after sale
</code></pre>

<h3>Types of people to interview</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- People who considered you and chose you
- People who considered you but choose your competitor
- People who considered you but decided to stick with status quo
- People who never considered you and choose another
- People who are currently considering your solution
</code></pre>

<h3>Securing an interview by contacting buyers</h3>
<p>"My name is <strong><em>, I am calling because you recently evaluated our solution. I am hoping that I can get a few minutes to talk with you about your experience as you went through the evaluation. I am looking for your candid feedback about what worked and what didn't as you went through the process. I'm hoping I can get about 20-mins time slot in your calendar within the next week. Here is my phone number </em></strong>. I realize that it may be easier for you to respond to me via an email, so I am going to follow up right now with an email. Looking forward to hearing back from you and hope we can talk soon."</p>

What they are hoping to get from the solution they are purchasing

- Insight #3 - Perceived Barrier:

what attitudes prevent your buyer from considering your solution

- Insight #4 - Buyer's Journey:

What resources your buyers trust as they consider your solution.
- The behind the scenes story about the work you buyers do to evaluate options, eliminate contenders and settle on their final choice.
- Which buyers are involved in the decision and how much influence they hold

- Insight #5 - Decision Criteria:

Which aspects of your solution are relevant or irrelevant to their buying decision.
