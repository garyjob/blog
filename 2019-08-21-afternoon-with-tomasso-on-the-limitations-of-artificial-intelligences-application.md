For us to be able to successfully apply artificial intelligence on any domain, the following needs to be true

 	- The behavior the system to be modeled must not be stochastic
 	- The state of the system must be decipherable by the data scientist

 	it should be possible to understand the state in which the system is at through interpretation of data gathered

 	- The domain can be modeled

 	the parameters for modeling the domain must be well defined

Only when all three premise are true can we determine where the adjustment should be made when a model fails to predict an outcome

The financial markets is stochastic  in the short run.

The underlying parameters are constantly changing and thus hard to model due to the emergent nature of impacts caused by human activities. The data is qualitative and thus hard to convert into clean quantitative datasets.

While the price movements are obvious it is hard, it is hard to attribute impact to the various parameters.

As such, it requires human neural networks that consumed all these qualitative data to perform the prediction/decision making.
