For excellent engineering practice the practitioner is encouraged to ask 5 Whys to understand the fundamental reason why a process breakdown occurs

For effective negotiation, the practitioner should absolutely avoid using the word "Why". This is because the use of the word "Why" leads to the need for the party on the opposite side of the table to justify him/herself. This instinctively leads to feelings of defensiveness on his side.

Rather, the practitioner should restrict himself to using phrases "How do we do..." and "What do we need for this to be...". This approach comes across as less contentious and allows the receiver an opportunity to candidly walk through his train of thought.
