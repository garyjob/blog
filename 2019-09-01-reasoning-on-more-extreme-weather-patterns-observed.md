August and September is the season for extreme weather patterns along the south eastern coast of major continents in the northern hemisphere.

Barely two weeks after [Typhoon Lekima](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/11/750299165/typhoon-lekima-makes-landfall-in-china-killing-dozens) (the costliest ones in Chinese history) hits South eastern coast of the China, [Hurricane Dorian](http://www.businessinsider.com/tropical-storm-dorian-track-hurricane-forecast-2019-8) (the largest one in US history) gets elevated to category 5 and is set to hit Florida, the South eastern coast of USA.

### Attempt at reasoning increased magnitude of storm patterns

Both Earth rotates eastwards and the trade winds blow westwards at a constant rate. This explains why storm patterns always occur along the east coast of continents.

Intensified greenhouse effect resultant from increased carbon emission has caused greater heat to be trapped resulting in generally a warmer ocean. This leads to greater temperature difference between the upper and lower sections of the buildup and thus more severe weather patterns.

This phenomena is the most acute along the equator during the season when:

 	- the northern hemisphere shifts from summer to autumn,
 	- the Southern Hemisphere from winter to spring and
 	- the equator is the hottest.

That happens to be during August and September.
### Approaches to capping out the magnitude of the storm

 	- Reduce the surface area of the water body the storm is allowed to build up momentum over. Reducing water supply in the ocean by freezing them up.
 	- Reduce the delta between the hottest and coldest temperature during the year. Reduce the amount of heat trapped within the earth's atmosphere.
