<h3>Key take aways</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- Central investment thesis:

Always bet against the central banks and with the real world
- truly down trodden people do not rise, but hell hath no fury like suppressed peoples whose expectations have been aroused
- people don't change their ways until their are forced to
- while it is easy to figure out an investment is cheap, the real work is figuring out if a change is about to occur in the near future. It is important to study markets and their history
- when seeing a big change coming (the opening of the trans Siberian railway), consider the economic, political and social shift

- modus operandi

Why buy a new sofa when it could be put to work in the markets
- Only invest in what I can sell quickly
- do nothing until you can see the money to be picked up around the corner

- key areas of study

geography
- politics
- economics
- history

- Company assessment criteria

Price to book value
- sound balance sheet
- pay dividend
- Price to earnings ratios
- Viable industries
- start with largest soundest enterprises

banks
- mines
- news papers

- On assessing countries

Watch out for statism - governments getting in the way of an organic market

democracy does not equal prosperity
- US government piling more and more regulations
- SnL crisis of the 1980s
- Artificially suppressed prices

1970s gold in America
- 2019 prices of pork in China

- Foreign aids (IMF, UN and Peace Corps) just props up a system that does not work and delays the actual rebuilding process. Have faith in the locals to rebuild themselves in a configuration that works for them as opposed to a system suited to foreigners liking (hubris)

- On ethnic strife and separatism

Some geographical boundaries don't make sense.
- no borders remain stable for long
- economic hardship will bring to surface these fault lines as they get used as a vehicles to get more
- Wait till wars are fought and border issues sorted out. It might then become a great investment opportunity to enter at the bottom
- examples

Rise of Islam and Christianity in Siberia prior to Soviet collapse
- Hong Kong riots
- Barcelona declaration of independence
- XinJiang, Tibet

- black markets as signals: difference between black markets rates and official exchange rates provide an indicator of how much the central bank has propped up the exchange rate. Minimal to no differences are signs of a strong economy
- major red flags:

currency controls, import taxes, export restrictions. Makes it hard to pull funds out
- is country trying to devalue its way out of its internal problems instead of doing a proper fix?
- frantic purchase of gold in local jewelry store

- Positive signal:

Is the country trying to get foreign hard currency by making things other people want to buy - quality goods
- Is the country learning to compete and out innovate its competition
- an educated population

- On centrally planned economies

the market feedback mechanism is missing
- resources get ruined due to misuse
- it would have thrive if it was a sound economic theory

- On China

while Russia abused their resources, China having nowhere to go were more deliberate and took better care of their resources
- success had a lot to do with economic and political organization
- example

took bees to blooming flowers to work them 5-7 times harder than their foreign counterparts

- Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shanghai being captured by the capitalist spirit generally ignores capital's policies

- Note worthy collations

China (labor) / Siberia (natural resources)
- Australia (natural resources) / Japan (capital)
- US (capital) / Canada (natural resources) / Mexico (labor)

- On commodities

most local markets will eventually get assimilated into the global market
- diamonds have artificially propped up prices that will be hard to maintain in the long run. DeBeers will eventually run out of cash buying up supplies from the black market and it will lead to sudden price collapse. Opt for gem and rubies instead
- when gold gets too cheap companies will figure out ways to use it thereby depleting its supply driving up price. Same could be said of oil
- underlying structural issues within a country can stay hidden for long during times of a commodity boom

- The key to success

out of every 1000 people who wants to be rich only 6 can master the discipline to do so
- stay focus on a single goal for five, ten, twenty years
