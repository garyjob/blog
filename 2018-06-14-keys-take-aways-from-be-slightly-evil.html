<pre class="codehilite"><code>- The more universal truths you uncover about the world, the less the number of moral opinions you will need
- In life, you will eventually be forced to decide between being somebody or doing something
- The unreasonable person adapts surrounding conditions to himself
- The straight path in your head turns to spaghetti in the real world vice versa
- The straight and narrow path grounded in truth seeking is the faster road to meaningful destinations
- Power handed to the untrained mind leads inevitably to mental damage
- The ability to see reality as it really is, in minimally deluded ways, leads inevitably to the earning of authority
- A CEO's job is to interpret external realities for a company, A.G. Lafley

survive a lack of incoming empathy
- generate a positive atmosphere and empathy for others under your &quot;information protection&quot; umbrella
- A startup team of two is better than solo entrepreneurs due to the sharing of &quot;information parenthood&quot;

- Idealism believes in change and creates believers who don't change whereas the opposite is true

The idealist goes into Zen Retreat and remains unchanged after he is done
- The realist starts a business and is forced to change

- Path to freedom

Integrating the self (addiction) and the shadow (aversions) to cover your whole personality
- Myer Briggs cognitive function

first four functions represent your self
- last four functions represent your shadow - usually triggered by stress

- Status

If status doesn't matter to you, it becomes available to you as a tool to control those whom status does matter
- consciously cultivate away this felt need

- The easiest way to figure out someone is to look at the information they choose to consume
- Handling information

Truth telling

requires you to calmly separate your feelings from facts and tell yourself the truth before you tell others
- cursing and candor both reflect an inability to bear the stress of being otherwise

- Cold blooded listening

listen for the data behind heated words
- don't take what you hear  about your personality as worth responding to
- freely draw your own conclusion about the data received

- Dissemination

the larger the group the fewer the key beliefs allowed to be conveyed
- at the level of human civilization use extremely simple but very fertile fill-in-the-blanks messaging

- Handling negotiation

most work is done away from the actual negotiating table
- Discovery pre-work conversation to tease out what people know and the trust relationship
- the more there is that mutually greed upon, the less there is to negotiate
- ignore sunk cost

- Choose to be effective instead of being liked
- On money

aim to be anti-fragile
- even millionaires are stuck in the psychology that the money is transient
- salary men are stuck in the illusion that the pay check will extend indefinitely into the future
