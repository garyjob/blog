- Buffer ample time to deal with the car dealer. Make sure you are not under any serious time constrains during the time phase of the engagement
 	- Make your stance absolutely clear about money and cost
 	- It is ok to take time off to think about the problem and it is ok to communicate it clearly to the service provider.
 	- Get itemized cost breakdown
 	- Question each and every item that has been listed with regards to its relevance of your goals
