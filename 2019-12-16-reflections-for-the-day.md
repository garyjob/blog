When travelling alone the primary focus of your attention is on the immediate surrounding you have put yourself in. When traveling in a pack the primary focus of your attention shifts to those within your pack. When wanting to immerse do the former when intending to become more intimate with someone do the latter.

When undertaking military affairs or activities performed under adverse environments, character weakness become apparent fast. Judgement must necessarily be passed  on allowed continued membership in the pack. Such judgements compared to those made under less adverse environments are permanent.
